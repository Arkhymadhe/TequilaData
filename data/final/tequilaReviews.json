The body is nice and the finish is pleasant but light. This is a good balanced Anejo where you can enjoy the age and agave equally. Well done Atanasio. Salud!",

Background aromas of butterscotch, vanilla and caramel. This is all held together with an oak presence that does not overwhelm the agave. Flavors:   Vibrant and vivacious profile. Caramel with assertive pepper and cinnamon. Yet sits nicely on the palate with silky fruit notes of cantaloupe drizzled with honey. Finish:   There is butterscotch retrohale, with pepper and light salinity. This loses some points on price point.  It is nearly double the price of the repo. But a fine tequila, none the less.",

I recently did a tequila tasting event for a bunch of guys who knew very little about Tequila and it was hands down the Atanasio Anejo was the clear favorite among 10 other Tequila\u2019s in its peer group.  If you are in the Houston area, send me a note and I can hook you up with a place to get it.  Or, if you are not in Houston, you can find it on siptequila\u2019s website.

A little bit of spice, but really the agave and honey notes are stealing the show. I get a little bit of aromatic floral notes but it\u2019s faint. Overall, an banger from Carlos Camarena. On my first tasting, I didn\u2019t love it but now that I come back to it, I am finding this to be absolutely fantastic. This is, in my opinion, the platonic ideal of blanco tequila.

Also some degree of black pepper and earthy, grassy notes, but not necessarily mineral notes.Taste : Cooked agave and black pepper spiciness. Some earthy, grass notes. Light celery, citrus, and medium oils. I actually got a little bit of vanilla from this which is an interesting sight for a blanco, but it doesn't take away from the experience.Finish : Short to medium length with more spice and agave. To a lesser extent some greener, vegetal notes from before.This Blanco has some really good spice that goes well with the other flavors. I can find this for $36.99 USD so there's a lot of value as well.",

On the palate, it\u2019s smooth, buttery agave with honey and caramel. Just a touch of heat at the end. Overall, it\u2019s similar to Tapatio, but deeper/more caramel. It does have more anise/licorice as well, which translates to more bitterness, which I\u2019m not a fan of. The buttery, caramel wears off slightly after a couple of weeks and becomes more anise/bitter.",

But when you sip it\u2019s soft and smooth with a little bite on the pallet then it goes down the throat smoothly. When you shoot it, you will feel the pepper burn on the delay. We tasted butter, sugar cane, and very faint citrus tones. We could smell heavy butter, and some citrus. Over all for the value and price it\u2019s a good tequila. The price is about $35-$50.

This lacks the richness of something like Fortaleza but offers a certain drinkability that makes it very likable. The nose is smoothly balanced agave, neither too peppery nor too citrusy, with a light undercurrent of that wet-cement-after-summer-rain smell. The palate is similarly well balanced, leaning less toward earth or pepper than toward citrus, maybe like tangerine, and even a puff of cotton candy. The finish is smooth, easy, solidly lasting \u2014 good old green agave. This is a quality product, deeply respectable not in a staid, personality-less way, but in the you\u2019ll-never-be-ashamed-to-have-this-around sort of way. Definitely recommended.",

        "Review": "A sweet fruity blanco tequila, that caught my attention for its crisp and zesty profile that keeps you indulging on it. Can be a versatile tequila as a sipper and a mixology component. Looking forward to explore with it on cocktails:Aroma: Agave is present but somewhat muted for my preference. Would like to know the maturity of the agaves, but can definitely assume its between 5-8 yrs. Also obtained, sweet fruity aromas as apples/pear along with earthy/grassy notes. A subtle back aroma of tangerine and an extremely friendly white pepper presence (please note its a 38% ABV). Minimal alcohol presence, this can be dangerous in the good way!Flavor: A bouquet of fruity notes that keep you wanting more. Eager to know the brix volume of the agaves, and the fermentation process to have such a fun and complex expression. Fruity: apples, pear, nectarine Citrusy: orange, tangerine, orange blossomsHerbal: sweet red bell pepper, sweet mintSpices: white pepper & jalapenoOther: mineralTexture/Finish: Warm sensation and buttery entrance, no harsh alcohol detected. Medium bodyA must try, definitely on the natural sweet side of tequila. Price is excellent!",

This can do double duty as a mixer and as a sipper.Nose: Beautiful.  Clean, vegetal, bright green agave and a splash of black pepper. A hint of lime citrus and jasmine. The initial alcohol on the nose dissipates after a little time in the glass-it is not off putting.Taste: Slightly sweet in the initial draw.  Medium viscosity and a slight oilyness with a balanced warmth.  The taste mimics the nose, but is it does have a little harshness. Still, very good.Finish: Long peppery warmth.",

It is a journey that starts by walking in the green forest and finishing in your lovely wooden cabin in the woods.That is what made me feel.",

A lingering bitterness in the taste carries through to the finish.   At $55 (Sip Tequila), this is priced to compete with the likes of Fortaleza or El Tequilino, yet fails to live up to that standard.Nose: Delicate and fresh.  Geranium, white peach, lemon citrus up front. Traces of fresh agave, mint, and jasmine. Taste: Soft on the tongue, but there us an immediate slight bitterness like you might find in artificial sweetners.  There is a white peppery warmth slowly builds.  Its definitely floral and fruit forward like the nose, but they overpower the agave. Faint hints of mint.Finish: There is a tart-bitternes of powdered lemonade that over shadows.

Flavors appear clean and crisp on the palate, but also not really complex. No burn, but also nothing develops on the tongue. Clear citrus, vanilla, and slightly salty...but nothing to really write home about. The finish is where this tequila truly shines...long, deep, and bright. But at roughly $120 a bottle, there are much better contenders in the market. Hell...buy two bottle of Fortaleza Blanco, your money will be much better spent.",

It hasn't been overpowered by the oak, but it does finish with a little vanilla and even smaller sweetness. This what I've been looking for in an extra anejo. (And I've tried many) I will purchase this again to share with friends and family. Yes, I enjoy it that much. YMMV.",

Notes of cooked agave, roasted nuts, baking spices, citrus, black pepper, and a slight lactic note as well. Flavor- on the pallet this tequila gave me notes of alcohol, citrus, pepper, and cooked agave. The lactic note is present but not in a creamy way like with some other lactic tequilas I\u2019ve had. The finish gives a hint of nutmeg and other baking spices for me as well. Mouthfeel was thinner than I prefer and the finish was short to short medium for me. This tequila lacked complexity I would have liked to see and was underwhelming on the pallet for being a 45%abv still strength product. I was craving more complexity. Front end of the pallet is fairly thin and the tequila starts to come alive around the end of the 2/3rd. The finish is the star of the show but it\u2019s short lived sadly. Not a bad option for the price point to experiment beyond your typical 40% blancos. Kuddos to Codigo 1530 for the creativity and innovation in the production process.",

While the 1 liter bottles used to be available locally for $40 (an outrageous value), but they\u2019re now selling for $52 (average price). Regardless of price, the flavor profile is exactly what I like in tequila and this will maintain a continuous presence on my bar.",

There is agave from aroma to the finish. That is a good thing.  The mouthfeel is watery with the addition of some pepper and vegetal character.  The finish adds more pepper to go with the agave. A little burn/kick which is appropriate.  Not one of my every day drinkers but still good.  Just be aware that some of the points are based on pricing and not the tequila itself. ",

Nice black pepper finish that gives way to mint, citrus, and anise.Overall, this is one of my favorite Blancos since it's so full of agave throughout. Such a mellow but flavorful profile. I noticed as it oxidized I picked up a lot more of the odd flavors like the cheese and especially anise. I'm not a big fan of licorice, but I dig this Tequila.",

Aroma: Bright, clean and inviting on the inital nose.  Sweet cooked agave, lemongrass floral notes, and olives up front.  Followed by herbal spearmint, black pepper, pineapple citrus, and anise. Taste: Soft with a delicate sweet and dry mouthfeel.  Just a tiny bit of black pepper heat on the initial taste. Cooked agave, grass, and black pepper dominate.  Mint, earth, and a mild salty oliveness on the mid palate.  Finish: The finish is excellent.  I'll steal from Don Heiser: 'starts with some fruit and moves to black pepper spice, is a long dry finish.' ",

As I bring the glass closer, oak, licorice, caramel, vanilla, and honey introduce themselves. All romas are very well rounded and play nicely with one another. Flavor: sweet agave and honey hit your senses 1st followed quickly by oak, baking spices, anise, and a soft warm pepper finish. The Agave isn\u2019t overpowered by aging, which I prefer as a blanco lover. This is definitely a must have for any collection!!",

I first smell agave and minerals before a floral fragrance appears. The fragrance is light and sweet with a hint of red grapes. It\u2019s a very pleasant experience. I taste the agave first and foremost but simultaneously some minerality and muted pepper appear. Throughout the sip there is a hint of a juicy red plum and grape notes that continues into the finish. The pepper quickly gives way while the sweetness stays.  The finish is short but it it leaves you wanting another sip. If a tequila could be light but flavorful and simple why still having complexity then this is it. Every Blanco and Reposado lover should have this tequila in their collection. Salud!",

        "Review": "Earthy sweetness. The agave is there, clearly, but it\u2019s more rounded off and I\u2019m getting something like a custard, maybe flan. On the palate, I\u2019m immediately struck by how little heat there is for an 82 proof tequila. Very oily and almost creamy, lots of agave. This one evolves quickly, I\u2019m getting earthy and olive brine notes, reminiscent of Fortaleza for me. But then my next sip is all agave and maybe a hint of grape. A very dry finish, clean and the earthiness lingers. This is definitely a good tequila. It\u2019s tasty, drinks super easy, and it has a simple complexity to it. On some sips, all I get is cooked agave, in others I get that earthiness and olive brine, and the barest hint of grapes. No two sips were the same for me. Very interesting, but at $75 + $15 for shipping + taxes, you\u2019re looking at nearly $100 per bottle and that\u2019s where it loses points for me. I wonder if this would hold up as well in blind tastings. Update: Trying the third batch and this is fantastic. Finish is much longer, very earthy and vegetal. I bought two bottles and I\u2019m happy I did. Maybe my palate has changed but I\u2019m enjoying this much more than the first batch. Still a little pricy but very good.",

The fact that the barrels originally had cabernet sauvignon compared to other varietals. Alongside trademark Cascahu\u00edn flavors such as cooked agave, grass, mouthwatering minerality, citrus these Bordeaux barrels add a unique layer. After these Cascahu\u00edn flavors pass the tastes and aromas of boysenberry, black currant, potting soil, cassis, and plum. As an old world wine lover this is a fantastic blanco. Now I\u2019m curious what a blanco rested in Beaujolais barrels would taste like\u2026",

        "Review": "Montagave Blanco Heritage ventures into a merge of the Old & New World by merging Tequila craftmanship and Bordeaux distinctive personality. This Blanco tequila rests in Bordeaux wine barrel for 29 days to create an attractive rose-gold champagne color hue that instantly catches anyone's eyes. Once you dive in, you're received by a fresh and floral aromatic bouquet that is complemented by the agave richness and invites you to delight on it. Aroma:Fresh and crisp floral/fruity profile, that doesn't overpower the cooked agave presence. Both layers work on a very balanced way and provide just the right complexity for any drinker to get curious about what's next. Sweet citrus and baking spices nuances also say hello towards the end. Notes: cooked agave, plum, grapes, dried cherries, apple, orange, flowers, white pepper & baking spices. Mineral personality. Flavors:This profile has a creamy/buttery entrance with minimal alcohol attack (obtained from a malolactic fermentation). The cooked agave sweetness has been maintained, but also elevated from the berry-like symphony obtained from the aging method. It is slightly complex, but very enjoyable for any type of drinker, meaning notes are very friendly and familiar making it easy to sip. As you keep sipping, notes evolve towards a fruity layer composed of grapes, plum, prunes, licorice, and dried fruits. Accompanied by a sweet citrus presence of orange and grapefruit, leaving just a small tart touch. The finish does leave a spice kick (white pepper, cinnamon & nutmeg) that I wasn\u2019t anticipating, but is still great.The end is short and tannic (dry), a sensation I mostly enjoy in wine, but pleasant in this profile. Notes: cooked agave, butter, prune, grapes, cherries, berry, dried fruit, grapefruit, orange, licorice, baking spices, raisins, mineral. Price: slightly overpriced at $75+",

Flavors jumping out of the glass.I was less fond of the Jamaican barrel finished expression, although I'm not typically fond of funky Jamaican rum either. As all things Ocho puts out, it's a top quality product so I probably would drink it again but wouldn't choose it from a lineup or pay for it if something else was available.",

But it lies to you (LOL!), as this tequila has a kick!! Jalape\u00f1o and black pepper with tobacco earth tones and a touch of sweetness before the long citrus peel finish.  This reposado is just as big and machismo as the blanco...maybe even BIGGER!",

I would drink again, but it's not my favorite reposado.Nose: Delicate.  When letting this sit in the glass, I will get similar notes that Grover picked up: Pine-like with citrus and tobacco. More often, I get a fruit forward nose with cooked agave, cinnamon, mandarin orange, plumb, tobacco, nutmeg, pepper and very like oak. I wish the nose had a larger presence. Taste: Mild butteryness with a slight cinnamon and peppry bite.  The balance, depth and boldness of the other notes are too light for liking: almond, oak, and vanilla.   Enjoyable, not but not sensational. Finish: Much like the blanco, the reposado provides a long finish: Cinnamon wamrth and slightly sweet agave.",

        "Review": "My first venture into Wild Common, and what an adventure it is. Good lord, the nose is gorgeous. Agave for days, very noticeable minerality. There\u2019s a light brininess, and a creamy citrus note, very orange peel for me. So fruity, and shockingly little ethanol for the proof. The palate is a real treat. One of those rare high proofs that you can tell is a high proof more because of the intense flavor than the alcohol. So much agave and minerals. Very clear white pepper, citrus, and tropical fruit.I would say that this is a little bit of a splurge bottle at $80+, but I\u2019m still going to give it 5/10 on score because it\u2019s really a step above. I\u2019m not a normally a huge fan of the Cascahuin flavor profile, but this is exquisite. This is the Cascahuin I\u2019ve been looking for. I ended up picking an entire case, because it really is that damn good.Edit: I am revising my review. Bumping this up to 6/10 on value and 30/30 on flavor. This is, to me, the best blanco currently in production. I haven\u2019t had anything that beats it, and I keep going right back to it. When I\u2019m in my blanco phase, this does it. When I\u2019m in a repo/a\u00f1ejo phase, this still is amazing. I take a month off of drinking, and this is what I want to come back to. Honest to God, this is my favorite tequila. I\u2019m sorry Tapatio 110, but you\u2019ve finally been unseated.",

A bright, clean nose that has depth, complexity, and balance.  Followed by honeydew melon, tangerine-lime citrus, maybe even the slightest hints of raisins.  Slight notes of green olive saltiness, mint, and lemongrass.  There is a lot to take in and things are constantly changing as this sits in my glass.Taste:  Creamy. Buttery.  A nice sweet and salty dance in the the mouth with a delicious white peppry heat, too.   You really want to chew this to get all it has to offer.  Floral and herbal notes jump out right away, followed by the more fruity notes.  Anise, bell pepper, carroway seeds,  banana-pear  fruits.  Traces of limon and green olives.

The high ABV accentuates the flavors without ruining the finish. The finish is unlike any other finish I\u2019ve experienced. There is a pleasant tingling thats long and a sweet.

The flavor picks up on the aroma and begins softly with vegetal flavors then evolves to a spicy black pepper and cinnamon. Finally, a bitter almond flavor emerges and carries into a long, lingering finish.This blanco takes a spot among some of the truly great blancos in the tequila universe. The aroma, flavor and finish combine into something special. However, with a price of $85 (from Astor Liquors) this blanco is double the price of other great blancos (Siete Leguas, Suerte, 123). So, it is hard to score the Criollo highly on value.11/03/2018",

There's almost a buttery flavor as well.Finish: Incredibly smooth. I'm surprised it's high proof because there is no burn but finishes really smooth and hangs around.",

There\u2019s lots of sweet agave and floral suggestions. Hints of cinnamon, toffee, licorice, mint. A touch of dandelion. Flavors:   Rich luxurious mouth feel, juxtaposing with vibrant notes of pepper, cinnamon and cloves. Super creamy agave sweetness.  Lite nutty hint.

I get aromas of citrus, a nice light smoke, light mint, fresh sweet agaves, and a naturally sugary and sweet aroma, with the slightest hint of cinnamon and some floral. The taste on this high-proof showed medium to thick oils, a little bit of heat, some anise, minerals, earthy, delicious sweet cooked agave, citrus, green fresh raw and bright, slightly fruity but smooth considering the abv, with a little touch of olive brine.\r\rThere's a touch of pepper and spice that comes on at the very finish, which is a long amazing ride.

        "Review": "Oh my. This is a special treat. Difficult figuring out where to start, so I'll begin at the end and work forward. Let's start with the finish. Killer, long lasting, super pleasant, naturally sweet, and evolving on your palate. For me, I really love a finish that does 2 things: 1) prolongs all of the things you love about the aroma and flavor, and 2) adds something new that the aroma and flavor didn't -- a surprise, if you will. This does exactly that. The finish brings a nice creamy, buttery, clean lingering end to each sip. Try this and you will feel waves of character evolving long after you've swallowed. \r\rFlavor: Cooked agave (omg, tons!) black pepper, some vegetal, and mineral notes as well on the palate. A solid example of what tequila can be, should a creator put their heart into it. The beauty here is in the subtleties and the delicate approach it takes. Agave is honored and respected, and allowed to give us its natural gifts.\r\rAroma: This is high proof, so the longer you allow it to open up, the more you get to experience. Don't rush this one because you'll miss a lot. I picked up on cooked agave, earth, and pepper immediately. After some time I detected some cinnamon and mint. Then brine/salt. Then butter. The evolving complexity of the aroma here is impressive. Let it open up and keep checking back to see what other gifts it wants to give you.\r\rBravo, Sophie, for your part in the creation of this masterpiece.",

The viscosity of the high proof (98.6 proof) is nicely apparent it gives it a silky texture. Not over buttery as I first thought, its just right and not to sweet at all. It has many layers some fruity notes and earthiness. I still feel that the Fuenteseca Cosecha 2018 is much better at the same price and other very good tequila blanco hp at a lower price point.

The more I sip the more I like it though, so perhaps I might bump a few points in the future. Definitely takes a hit on the value portion of the scoring.",

I let this sit for over an hour and it is delicious. got more anise on the finish this time. still lovin it.5/20/21 Finally opened the Calle 23 last nt. It was yummy. Hit u in the face with sweet cooked agave. Nose: In addition to the sweet cooked agave, I got some mint, floral, earthy/vegetal scents and a touch of pepper. Taste:  Sweet cooked agave and that special fruity taste (I call it bubblegum flavor like I get with Paradiso), the mint is still there as is the vegetal flavors and the pepper is more prominent in the taste than nose.",

Sophie Decobecq is onto something that is truly unique from any tequila I have ever tasted.On the nose I pick up strong agave with a trace of mint, while it sits more floral on the palate introducing what I would almost equate to a lavender taste, among a bouquet of other flavors.The alcohol content of the high-proof is certainly there but you almost forget because the finish is so smooth. Yet just enough lingers to leave a light tingle on your tongue while you wait for your next sip.",

There is also mint and minerals in the nose. -The palate is more agave, mint, minerals, vegetal, and strong pepper. Not the pepper that hits you hard, but pepper that builds in intensity and stays with you. There is a definite brininess to it as well. -The finish is lightly sweet as the agave fades. The pepper hangs in a bit longer.  The final remnants are the brine and the minerality.  They have packed a sack lunch because they will be staying a while. This is honestly so powerful that I don't think I'd want it every day. This tequila is so profound, it reminds me of a quote from Kill Bill 2. I paraphrase:If you're gonna compare this tequila.. ...you compare it to every other tequila ever made - wasn't made - like this.",

This is an extremely unique tequila that is a must try for anyone serious about tequilas. Most producers I met kind of despise these small \"criollo\" agaves, yet this tequila contradicts that. An amazing expression I love how long the finish is and how it evolves. To me it is kind of earthy and minty on the nose with agave notes. It has a nice long finish with peppery, minty, agave flavors, than it evolves into jusicy acidic fruity like apple and then in the end it has some vegetable, earthy, drier feel to it. It feels like riding a rollercoaster.",

        "Review": "My first time tasting this was at a bar in Copenhagen Denmark, the Barking Dog. I was tasting some Siembra Valles earlier with Carl Wrangel at his \u201cShop\u201d Shoppen. We then went to the bar where I was drinking a tequila grapefruit cocktail. Carl then comes by the table and leaves my wife and I a generous pour of a blanco tequila. I approached it not knowing what it is. We sat there and smelled it for a while before even tasting. We got lots of cooked agave with a very herbal and floral aromas. A lot was going on. I also smelled notes of petrichor which made me think of only a couple of old school blancos I love. Then tasting it blind I was blown away. Definitely tons of cooked agave that didn\u2019t go away. Other vegetal notes of mint. The finish on this tequila was very looong. I had to know what I was tasting so I asked Carl. He knew I couldn\u2019t visit Copenhagen without him sharing this most wonderful tequila. I look forward to next week sharing this with my good friend here at home who appreciates the finer things. Other than him I will be hoarding this for myself. 7/14/18",

I absolutely love the smell.After that, it's a really good tequila. Taste is heavily influenced by the French oak. I'm really curious how this would change if the agave were cooked low and slow. I believe the HP autoclave was an unfortunate shortcut. I'll definitely drink more, but believe it fell short of its potential.It loses points on value, as I feel it's a bit overpriced.",

This is their Blanco that has been matured in French and American Oak barrel then blended harmoniously together to create this beautiful Tequila! The aroma of fresh agave is definitely present then you get some toast from the barrels. This tequila sings! Great by itself or even better in a cocktail. We did a riff on the Espresso Mexicano! The Number Juan Reposado shined through! Coffee and Repo Tequila are now a thing in our cocktail repertoire! Probably one of the top 5 cocktails I have ever made. It is no secret that the Number Juan Reposado was the right call! A Reposado that stands apart from the crowd! Highly recommend by A Couple of Drinks with The Clarks show!",

Loads of caramel, oak, agave, little vanilla, little fruit and some grassiness which is interesting mixed with pitted fruit. With a medium to long finish with caramel or butterscotch that stays on the tongue.  Little pepper Definitely enjoyable but a good light everyday sipper. Nothing super complex. But good",

I enjoy a sweet tequila but all I noticed was the peppery heat and alcohol sting. Don\u2019t get me wrong it wasn\u2019t horrible, but it\u2019s not worth the 50$ price tag.

After coating the glass, small tears take a while to form before quickly rolling down the glass, leaving a few pearls hanging.Aroma: Let this open up for a couple of minutes to let an initial alcohol aroma to dissipate. Green pineapple, green agave, green apple. I presume these \u201cgreen\u201d notes are from cooking the agaves in an autoclave. Light oak and pepper.Entry: Buttery and slightly sweet, pepper presents quickly.Flavor: Buttery, sweet and peppery, soft agave notes. The sweetness is like that of a white fruit such as apple or pear, but does not really come with its own flavor. The butter notes are from the virgin American oak rather than baked agave. The pepper quickly consumes the experience.Finish: Big pepper with a little sweetness and agave for moderate length. Moist with some dry tannins.Conclusion: The agave flavors are fairly basic and \u201cgreen\u201d due to baking the agaves in the autoclave. The barrel notes are pleasant and what you might expect from virgin American oak. This is a worthy profile and welcome addition to the Don Pilar lineup. If you want to try a repo that doesn\u2019t have whiskey/bourbon notes, or the chocolate/coffee notes you would get from virgin French oak, check this out. Priced at $37-40, it\u2019s an excellent value.",

Some sourness and a citric acid tang on the tongue like too many sour patch kids is not a bad thing at all as this fades and finishes on some great sweet agave vinegar notes.

This has a \"aged\" character to me that is a departure from the standard blanco profile.The taste is similarly unique, with an inexplicably balsamic background behind a core of cooked agave and orange peel flavor. Like other reviewers, I think this vinegar note actually works quite well and augments the classic agave flavors in a thought provoking way. Lingering and pleasant peppery bitterness on the finish.NOM 1414 again producing quite a unique-tasting tequila. I've tried their ArteNOM reposado expression and was similarly impressed by the atypical flavors they have coaxed out of agave. While it's flavors are probably not in the comfort zone for most tequila drinkers, this bottle goes to show how different even a blanco can taste. Highly reccomended for anyone looking to taste a unique tequila.",

Very heavy rye whiskey presence in the taste which reminds me of the aged Celestial Tequila products  aged in Wild Turkey Rye barrels. I know there are fairly pristine WT Rye barrels in the NOM 1480 barrel warehouse along with another rye and some other not often seen whiskey distillery barrels as well. It has a very rich flavor of rye whiskey from the extended aging and the 50% ABV. If rye whiskey barrel aged tequila is what you seek, go for this at La Cata in Tequila, Jalisco MX. Edit to add that I have tasted this XA to the tune of a half bottle over the last month, both from a Glencairn glass and Romeo's jarrito to form this opinion.",

As such, alcohol fumes didn't get in the way of my tasting experience.\r\rThere's definitely a lot going on here in the aroma. Just like any good natural spirit, don't rush this one. It will continue to open up in the glass and surprise you.\r\rAt first, I detected white chocolate in the aroma. Then came the cinnamon, barrel spice, and fruit. A little while longer some jalape\u00f1o and citrus.\r\rThe flavor follows the aroma, but this is where the oak and barrel spice become much more obvious.\r\rHas a thick and oily texture in the mouth, and the finish lasts for a long time. Thumbs up on this one.\r\rYou can only get it at the La Cata tasting room in downtown Tequila, though. And it's a single barrel, so it won't last long. I recommend picking one up soon!",

        "Review": "NOM 1079 version.Date: Originally reviewed 6/8/2012, update 8/24/2013.Source: My private collection.Setup: Riedel Overture glass, neat, room temperature.History: Although 1921 blanco, reposado and anejo continue to be produced, this Reserva Especial Reposado version is no longer in production. It\u2019s a terrific treasure bottle if you can find it. The brand was named \"1921\" to commemorate the final year of the Mexican Revolution. This is a highland tequila that was originally produced at NOM 1079 (Agave Tequilana Prod. y Comercializadores, SA CV). 1921 is no longer produced in NOM 1079 and is now produced in NOM 1535 (Destileria Morales, S.A. de C.V.). Production: 1921 Reserva Especial Reposado is double distilled using copper pots. (The new juice produced at NOM 1535 is distilled in stainless steel pots with copper coils). Aged between 9 and 14 months in 200 liter medium charred American oak barrels. The barrels are only used 5 times. The first time it used the tequila is aged for only 9 months. For the second use of the barrel, the tequila is aged for 11 months, the third use for 12 months, the forth use for 13 months and final use for 14 months. Although all of bottles are designated as reposado some are aged over 12 months and could be considered an anejo.Tasting Notes: This bottle used for this review is marked LOTE No. 190. This is a single barrel tequila so you can expect variances from lot to lot. I tasted it in a Riedel glass at room temperature after breathing for 10 minutes. Color: Deep golden straw color. Looks more like an anejo than a reposado. Nose: Right from the nose I knew I would love this Tequila. Aromas of caramel, apricot and cherry with a hint of lemon, mild agave but not much wood coming through and very little alcohol. Entry: On entry you get hit with lots sweet buttery agave, fruit and mild oak. Body: Complex and smooth with a sweet tone. Flavors of cooked agave, pepper, caramel, a little oak with a nice oily mouth feel. There is no bitterness and it has a very well balanced alcohol tone throughout. Others have described it as smoky but I\u2019m not picking that up. I\u2019m getting loads of sweet fruity agave, and loving it. Finish: Medium in length with hints of vanilla, spice, fruit with mild heat and agave coming through. The 1921 Reserva Especial is one of my favorite reposados, but unfortunately as I mentioned, it is no longer produced.",

If your budget allows for it, this should be in your collection. It takes the original XA to new layers of depth with a little higher ABV. Congrats Volans.

Our first sip awoke our palate with juicy citrus flavors, the second sip revealed layers of complex notes, and our third sip left us with a long lasting elegant finish steeped in El Pandillo terroir.  Felipe is the ultimate maestro, and this 6yr XA is one of his greatest works of art.  Very highly recommended.",

The alcohol is definitely there but wasn\u2019t as a prominent on the nose or in flavor as I expected from a high proof. Helps add to the flavor without overpowering all the other amazing flavors of this tequila. Very complex flavor with bright agave and pepper, minerality and I get a little molasses, brown sugar, cinnamon flavor as well. Finish is long and absolutely delicious. Every sip I seemed to find more flavor. One of my favorites and a tequila I just keep coming back to.",

Your curiosity will have you smell the aroma and you\u2019ll get alcohol, pepper and a heat.  The taste will be heavy agave but still have the alcohol and black pepper.  The finish is hot and medium smooth.  With the rested glass you lose the alcohol and the agave and pepper come forward.  The finish becomes smooth without the burn.  This is a wonderful sipper if you are patient.  Be patient. I prefer Terralta and Gran Dovejo but this is pleasing. ",

The neck pour was a little more alcohol-predominant, but the following glasses (especially after letting it rest for about 10 minutes) really allows the strong flavors to shine through. In a margarita, the flavors come through equally as well and compliments the other ingredients perfectly. This is definitely going to be a regular purchase.",

Its a pleasant burn though not harsh at all. its more heat than burn. It\"s silky texture and burn is actually perfect. some complexity though.\u00a0I get that nice sweet roasted cooked agave any more I think would take that sweetness over the top. The long agave notes last throughout its profile. it has lots of pepper, some citrusy grassy and earthy notes. needs to be let out and open up a bit. oh and Value that gives it a really good score. I can get this for about $50 i can't think of another bottle with this quality at this price. maybe the artenom 1123 at $55 comes to mind.",

Sweet almond, buttered popcorn entry... very mellow initial flavor for a 110, but quickly gives way to green peppercorn, spice, brine, lime and roasted agave lingering on and on and on for an incredible, deliciously long finish. Long legs. Packs a punch. Not for the novice or faint hearted.",

Black pepper, cooked agave, celery, and some clay/earthy thing going on.The taste and finish are absolute showstoppers.  An abundance of green flavours: celery, green chartreuse, sage, green bell pepper, and lime zest.  That black pepper and cooked agave are also noticeable.The finish is loooooong, dry, and herbaceous.At $78 cnd, this is a bargin and the taste completes with any blanco on the market.

It checks all the boxes that the Ocho Plata does.  The oily legs linger in the mouth during the finish and leave a nice, classy pepper memory.

I found it for $39.99 and now.own 3 bottles.the nose features some.amazing aromas of cooked agave, cinnamon and oak.  really nice creamy mouth feel with cooked agave on the front followed by chocolate and vanilla.  such a well rounded flavor profile. on the finish it has a little of peppery burn and  an vanilla caramel-dish flavor that makes you want to have a other sip.  if you like anejos, you owe yourself the chance to try this gem.  I really do enjoy sipping this neat.. get it you won't be sorry.",

        "Review": "Date: Originally reviewed 8/21/2013.Source: My private collection.Setup: Riedel Overture glass, neat, room temperature.I thoroughly enjoyed this tequila which is from from NOM 1412 (Destiladora de Los Altos, S.A. de C.V.) which also makes Hacienda Vieja tequila. The distillery is located in Arandas which is in the highlands (Los Altos). It is named after Don Felix Ba\u5358uelos, the founder of the distillery and patriarch of a widely recognized tequila family from Arandas. The price is around $50 for a 750ml bottle. Don Felix is double distilled. This is definitely a tequila made for sipping neat. I prefer a Riedel which I used for this tasting. Don Felix has an initial aroma of light fruit, peach - maybe a little apricot, caramel, some cooked agave, a hint of honey and very little oak. It is very pleasing on the nose.It has an oily, rich, creamy mouth feel. The taste starts with hints of vanilla, fruit and cooked agave and spice. It has just the right amount of sweetness. This is an extremely smooth anejo, with very little burn, and a lot of flavor. The finish is long lasting with again, a lot of flavor including oak and more spice. I keep using the word flavor but don't worry it's not the kind overburdening flavor that makes you wonder if essence or sweeteners were added, but the type of flavor that reminds what good anejo should taste like. I highly recommend it.",

Nose: at first this blanco was nothing but alcohol. I let this one sit for about ten minutes given the age. After about ten minutes it opened up and I got notes of mineralogy, agave and citrus but also still quite a bit of alcohol. Palate: the taste instantly reminded me of vacations in Mexico. Agave bomb for sure but also a ton of minerals, almost metallic. Citrus and pepper on the back end. Finish: this particular blanco actually left me with quite a bit of heat in my chest and throat. There was also a lingering bitterness. I\u2019m glad I was able to experience this one. While it wasn\u2019t my favorite it\u2019s a great budget additive free option that has a finish much more stronger than a typical 80 proof. Would be a great mixer.",

Excellent. Some nice caramel notes reveal themselves at the very bottom of the glass.Entry: Smooth and slightly sweet and buttery with a touch of pepper.Flavor: Big cooked agave notes, sweet butter, apple and black pepper with a hint of grapefruit.

I want to echo Erica Boroom's evaluation, as she is spot on.Nose: Mellow oak bourbon barrel notes up front. Light cooked agave, and vanilla. Before this opens up, it can come across as Hay.  Faint  traces of banana, earth, and mint.Taste: Mild honey like sweetness, a macadamia nut butteriness, with some peppery warmth.  Mild cooked agave, carmel, slight vanilla, bell pepper, along with bourbon barrel notes are so well proportioned. The longer I sip this, the greater I appreciate what Tapatio has done with this one.Finish:  Simple. A little light cinnamon warth that sticks around for just a little while.",

A hint of the bourbon barrel shows some ankle in the background. Some orange marmalade on the retro nasal.A medium to long finish is where the pepper creeps in nicely.Another great aged expression from Carlos Camarena where the agave still is the star of the show (as it should be). This is a must have reposado. Extremely well balanced, easy to pick up flavors, but not an overly complex (a tribute to Carlos Camarena, because the agave shines through). Certainly a top reposado for me. Added plus - great price point, 1 ltr bottle and a screw cap for easy travel. Could sip it all night.",

I get some light honey notes, fresh fruit and some light spices from the Virgin American White Oak barrels. I taste creamy cooked agave and peppery barrel spices then some warm honey. There is a nice mouthfeel and some pepper and alcohol tingle on the finish like a nice warm hug. This is a nice Anejo with some depth. I get more on the nose than the pallet but it\u2019s a good sipping Anejo. I\u2019m positive it\u2019s additive free. Go get some! Salud!",

On the palate is balanced with a medium mouthfeel. Again Caramel and oak, although less than expected from the aroma and the same goes for a mild sweetness, which for me is a plus in an a\u00f1ejo (I tend to dislike over-oaked and very sweet a\u00f1ejos). This is a well done a\u00f1ejo. It's definitely my favorite one in the line, although I would have liked a bit more of complexity and oiliness. I could drink this one all night.",

        "Review": "They make a 55% that cannot be purchased in the States,  it\u2019s made in very limited batches and not every year.  I have a bottle #55 of 125, and yes this is validated by the family of the Distillery.   This is a very fine example a true sipping tequila, and not just with anyone, but for someone who appreciates the craft.  The final roll of the back of the tongue is what separates this from everything else.  Do not ruin this with a slice of pear, orange etc,  keep it as neat as possible and enjoy.",

On the palate, I\u2019m definitely getting that caramel, and honey, but a nice hint of red apple. The oak is surprisingly not overpowering for an 8yr XA. Very nutty and toffee sweet, delicious.

Having tried the other Suerte expressions, I still didn't know what to expect. Aroma: Oak, caramel, toffee, green apple, honey, and slight alcohol. I really like the nose on this.Flavor: Oak, spice, slight pepper, caramel, and still some faint agave at the end. Finish is on the longer side, but the flavor starts mellowing out somewhat quickly.Overall, a good extra a\u00f1ejo that's easy to drink. I wish, however, that it offered a bit more personality and complexity.",

        "Review": "Very nice XA from the mind of Felipe this was provided by the brand as a 100ml sampler along with the Blanco and Reposado. I've nursed this in small tastes of 10 to 15ml for as long as I could. This has a good balance between the oak flavors from aging and the sweet fruitiness of the roast agave. Made at El Pandillo with only well water, this doesn't strike me of having the minerality of another product made with only well water, Tequila Terralta. Nor does it with other raters as it is mentioned by no one and isn't listed in the 12 notable aromas and tastes on the app product page. Aerated as are several other products from 1579 it has a pleasing easy to sip character. I think price equals value here with the state of current tequila pricing.",

There are hints of oak, caramel and vanilla. The nose is so juicy that it\u2019s hard to let it rest. The buttery cooked agave and baking spices (nutmeg, anise & vanilla) hit right up front. There\u2019s some light pepper notes and oak notes that follow. A nice alcohol tingle is present and the agave sweetness carries from beginning to end. There\u2019s nothing dry about this excellent XA.This XA is NOM1579 goodness. Its mature estate grown agave that\u2019s cooked in Felipe\u2019s unique stone ovens before it\u2019s shredded by Igor and then crushed by Felipestein. It\u2019s then fermented in jacketed stainless steel tanks with  before being double distilled in copper stills. After that the tequila is oxygenated to help unify the flavors and soften the mouthfeel.Currently this tequila is only in Texas but its worth seeking. Salud!",

        "Review": "By production notes, this is similar to Terralta extra a\u00f1ejo, but with oxygenation. This is definitely a different product, though. The nose is different, and to me, has a very nice apple characteristic (may be perceived differently by others). I have found this apple like note common amongst aged products out of El Pandillo, which I really like, but it's much more vibrant in this one. The peppery notes present in the blanco and reposado are less pronounced as more oak characteristics take over from the long aging process; these oak characteristics are still quite subtle, likely due to the subsequent use of older barrels, which is common at El Pandillo. The finish is medium in length and the peppery notes come out for a bit.",

The Anejo however is quite good, and 5$ shots makes it all the better. I had written off Dulce Vida but now it\u2019s back on my radar. It has almost no aroma but the severe burn of the blanco is also gone. Flavor is light, very light but hints of agave and oak are noticeable. Short finish but did I mention it was 5$!

Once it opens up I get scents of wet grass, some pineapple, banana, lemon, hay, rose, baby oil and cream soda.Taste: not very complex taste, but it is very good. The alcohol leaves some lip numbness (which I dont mind). I get agave, pepper, banana, and grapefruit.Finish: The finish stays with you. It is a nice blend of oregano and mint.

Wow, this aroma is very complex. Palate:Instantly hit with sweet caramel and pepper. Cooked agave, and that whiskey note coming through. I\u2019m getting only a faint hint of vanilla, but it\u2019s there. Definitely fruity, though I can\u2019t pinpoint a specific fruit. Verdict:Interesting, a tasty tequila, and one I would recommend trying. It won\u2019t be a staple in my bar, but when I\u2019m looking for something fruity and peppery, I\u2019ll reach for this.",

This is a good balance between sweet and spicy, while still letting you get the full complexity of each side.Finish : Long with stronger notes of vanilla, berry, and oak.There is a lot going on here. It's obvious there is a ton of complexity with this one to the extent that if someone told me this was an extra a\u00f1ejo, I'd probably believe them.

The dark, rich color looks great in the glass and the nice legs upon a slow swirl add to the experience.  The aroma begins with cooked agave and caramel.  The flavor adds some butterscotch as you become aware of the barreling.  Light oak at this stage.  The finish is medium oily which creates a nice coating.  There is still the agave and caramel but now a touch of citrus and cinnamon.  I also get the pepper which gives some warmth.  A correlation may be a nice whiskey/scotch that lends itself to good conversation between friends and perhaps a mild cigar.",

I\u2019m not good at judging short vs long finishes, but I like this caramel with low to medium heat finish.  I get a slight bitter aftertaste of oak.",

Nose is roasted agave, no harshness whatsoever, green peppers, vanilla, citrus, tea.Taste is herbal and spicy with notes of thyme, spearmint, tea, blueberries, vanilla, caramel, dark chocolate, almond.The finish is medium-long, starts out spicy with notes pepper, nutmeg, along with notes of vanilla, caramel.Feels refined, rich, creamy, balanced, smooth, subtle, complex, has sweetness but leaves a drying sensation at the end of the finish.Primera vez probando ArteNom.El color es cobre obscuro, caoba. De piernas bastante viscosas, aceitosas.En nariz es de agave tostado, sin asperezas, pimientos verdes, vainilla, c\u00edtricos ligeros, t\u00e9, caramelo.El gusto es herbario y especiado con notas de tomillo, menta verde, t\u00e9, ar\u00e1ndanos, vainilla, caramelo, chocolate negro, almendra.El final es medio-largo, comienza especiado con notas de pimienta, nuez moscada, junto con notas de vainilla y caramelo.Se siente refinado, rico, cremoso, equilibrado, suave, sutil, complejo, tiene dulzor pero deja una sensaci\u00f3n de sequedad al final del final.Al principio me desanim\u00f3 porque no era tan tradicional como me gustar\u00eda.

Aromas alone are incredible: dark fruit, nuttiness, slight caramel with baking spices and agave still reigning king under all the aging. The taste is a thicker mouthfeel with peppery bight in the first sip but it turns into buttery, super well rounded easy sipper. I can\u2019t find any complaints on this. It\u2019s complex but easy to dissect at the same time as you sip. This makes a great winter sipper or summer nightcap drink. Highly reccomend.",

I imagine a place with some count plotting a field burning. Now, we are three people hanging out talking about this tequila. We have a proselytize, a follower, and a heathen. The proselyte raves about the way her life is enriched by the taste and the gentle fade, the follower likes the initial heat, and the heathen tastes a super bitter thing five seconds after swallowing. Maybe heathen should not eat sheep cheese before doing a tequila tasting.",

        "Review": "Okay 1579 fans. Felipe and El Pandillo have created another exquisite juice in the name of Volans. I have already rated the XA, which is amazing, but now we tackle the blanco. Typical highlands tequila with green apple, pear, raw asparagus and unripe banana. Seems the brix is perfect around 35 ish, making for a great juice. There is a little smoke to this which differentiates this from Terralta, Pasote or G4, slightly.",

        "Review": "I love Blanco Tequila and Felipe Camarena! The nose is wonderful. I detect a lot of agave, minerals, brine, citrus, lemon grass and some light floral notes. The flavor is excellent. The fresh agave and citrus notes are followed by a nice mix of pepper and brine. The finish is all agave and it goes down easy. It has a nice round feel mostly likely from the oxygenation. Overall this is a perfect sipping blanco for my pallet. If you enjoy sipping blancos then you should add this to your collection. Great job Volans and El Pandillo!\u00a1Salud!",

Some sweetness develops on following sips along with some pleasing mineral notes. This uses all 3 available water sources in its production and it shows in the taste and finish as elements bloom, cover up others and then reveal those again as the finish develops and fades. Nice pepper and spice on the tongue lead to a long satisfying finish.",

Ultimately, I expected more flavor at this price point especially after smelling that incredible agave punch. Terralta has a similar taste profile at a much lower price. The finish is clean but peppery. My preferences out of El Pandillo are G4, Terralta and Primo. For a few more $$, I\u2019d grab the Primo instead of the Volans. It\u2019s more interesting.

Not as \u201csmooth\u201d as other blancos from this distillery, but made up for with tons of depth and full-bodied flavors.Although they\u2019re all great, I think this is more complex than G4 and Pasote.

The nose is sweet, slightly floral with a little bit of that Fortaleza brine. Baking spices and a little bit of straw. Fruitier than the still strength I\u2019ve been drinking lately. The nose very much translates in the palate, with the fruitiness and cooked agave coming through. It\u2019s a gorgeous sweetness that comes through, with a plethora of beautiful flavors.

That sharp punch Im used to with some altos tequilas is missing, and on the first sip, all I get is the agave bomb. As I\u2019m sipping more, I\u2019m getting citrus, like if an orange peel and a lemon peel had a baby, but that baby was not Meyer lemons. Maybe a slight touch of vanilla, and a little earthiness. Absolutely delicious, complex but subtle and agave forward.Great blanco.",

        "Review": "Lot 100|The nose is...different, yet familiar to me. Produced in a different manner than all previous lotes, the agave is from a different area than is typically used and it claims to be distilled to proof at 40%. Prior lotes were typically agave primarily from the Valle, though not always and usually distilled to 46% and recently bottled at that ABV for the Still Strength Blanco. This has an sharp medicinal note on the nose that I find in the current El Tesoro Blanco, not surprising as the agave used is from Los Altos same as ET. Since the rest of the production is basically unchanged all the difference, for me, is easily attributed to these 2 changes. Once sipped this is classic Fortaleza, wood vat fermented with ambient yeast, twice distilled in several copper pot stills and bottled, in this case, without any added water. Roast agave, outstanding viscosity bordering on chewy, great natural sweetness and a long fading finish highlight some of the greatest Tequila Blanco yet produced by Tequila Fortaleza.",

Sweet creamy roast agave and that cheesy, musty and sour smell and taste that only Fortaleza and Suerte seem to make these days. Seek this out and buy it when you find it. Tasted again on 8/5/15 and it is even better. Edited to note the leak was from a corner of the bottle and not cork.",

Really beautiful nose. The flavor is equally rich with agave and earthy herbal flavors and a slight mineral undertone. There is a great lingering pepper finish of moderate intensity that leaves the top of the palate dry while the sides experience moist citrus notes. This is an excellent value for an excellent tequila.",

In the front of the mouth it\u2019s caramel, agave, and vegetal. In the back of the mouth it\u2019s buttery, spices, anise, and agave. A few sips are very rewarding, but serval sips in a row makes for a lasting alcohol and cooked agave warmth on the tongue that will obscure subtler flavors in favor of grass, spices, and eventually cantaloupe.

When I finally did pick up a couple bottles, I made the mistake of trying the still strength before the blanco and I missed some of the stronger flavor presences when tasting this initially. However, this lives up to all of the hype and it\u2019s easy to understand why it\u2019s becoming so popular. Very, very good.",

This blanco is very briney, earthy, peppery, and vegetal with light grass and minerality. Sweet cooked agave is everywhere and there\u2019s a really nice olive presence as well. The profile reminds me of the 2018 Fuenteseca (my favorite blanco) and I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s due to the maturity of the agave. Comparing the two, this is less complex but it\u2019s also ~$60 cheaper so it\u2019s way more practical for sipping. There are a ton of rich, full-bodied flavors here that are complimented by a spicy finish. I\u2019m looking forward to the rest of the bottle.",

The flavor matches the nose. It\u2019s both excellent and I\u2019m still stuck on not what I expected. Very clean finish. Doesn\u2019t have much of the oiliness that I\u2019ve come to enjoy in exceptional tequila. It\u2019s excellent. Don\u2019t get me wrong. For me, I prefer the standard Still Strength as a pure expression of what I expect Fortaleza to taste like. But it\u2019s outstanding tequila and a very cool Lot that people should experience if they\u2019re hard core tequila nerds.",

The finish is reminiscent of the regular blanco\u2014smooth with mild heat and some pepper. Long lasting. Overall improvement on the regular blanco. We will have to compare side by side. Fun!",

Agave, olive, pepper, cinammon, apple, jalape\u00f1o, bell pepper, celery and some oregano. Excellent thick mouthfeel with some sweetness I cant identify. Some honey maybe?Finish: nice medium finish that leaves a taste of mint/lemon on the tongue. Nice warm coat on the throat, but not harsh at all.This review was for was lot 89. I had tried this before and enjoyed much more than i did this lot, but i dont remember what lot it was. Either way, its definitely one to always keep on hand.",

And thanks to the Fortaleza Blanco I am hooked.You just can't get the flowery and sweet agave flavors from other base material.Even though it could be a bit more mellow, there is only a minor alcohol burn. But the rich exemplary tequila flavors would definetely suffer from aging or other softening.Looking forward to try the reposado and anejo some time but for my next bottle I will get the Blanco again.",

Not harsh, very smooth, but not lacking the alcohol taste either.  It finishes by hanging around a long while with some citrus, light pepper, and a very mild grass.

Distilled by a 5th generation Sauza, this tequila is still made the old style way with a Tahona and old school methods. The bottles are hand blown and the real cork pi\u00f1a stopper symbolizes this brand.Aroma: Cooked agave, touch of earthyness, black pepper, olive and butter. Really pleasant.Initial Taste: Superb creamy agave entry.Body: Wonderful amounts of agave and the pepper spice that goes along with it. The sweetness from the agave and the fruit is still there as well. Complex...while still being light and pleasant with no burn or bitterness.Finish: Ultra smooth. A hint of pepper and fruit remain while a nice agave flavor lingers. nicely for a medium duration.This is just a superb tequila from top to bottom. From the bottle, to how it was crafted to every aspect of the flavor in your mouth this is a winner. The fact that it can pretty easily be found for under $50 makes this probably my favorite blanco. Go out and get bottle. I'm pretty darn sure that you won't regret",

        "Review": "This is one of my favorite blancos, it has so much flavor! Roasted agave is very apparent on the nose, followed by a butteriness laden with olives and citrus. Underneath the bright citrus lies a deeper, earthier vegetal aroma that carries a whiff of spice from white pepper, then fades to raw agave and a dash of mint. The taste is wonderfully spicy and sweet, with blasts of roasted agave intertwined with hits of black and white pepper. There is also a rich, creamy vanilla flavor that lies atop a foundation of the earthy vegetables from the nose. This finished up with a splash of citrus and brine, a very crisp and refreshing tequila.",

This is mystical stuff, a presentation of agave so bewitching, so mesmerizing that it has you constantly going back for another sniff, another sip, caught between trying to make sense of it and yet soak freely in its glory all at the same time. Extreme praise, I know, but there really are few times when a drink catches you so off guard as this. The nose is soft and rich, petrichor, lush garden flowers, jasmine, a light undercurrent of pepper. The palate is buttery, rich, almost moist agave, some tropical fruit like lychee perhaps, a light sweetness that never gets untoward, something even like olive oil too. A very pleasant tingling, almost cooling, emerges in the finish, rich agave and light pepper carrying throughout. This is, clearly, gorgeous stuff, not unlike the decanter it comes in. An all-time great and one of the surest fire ways to make an agave convert of anyone.",

This tequila can not get away from the overall taste of olive juice to me. Briney almost like a pickle juice. Would perhaps recommend but I don\u2019t think it is my favorite flavor profile.",

Nose: there's a distinct, and very noticeable mushroom aroma that dominates...supported by cooked agave, and acetone...I noticed a little bit of sea air, and pickling spice...other notes are fleeting, some tropical fruits; starfruit, pineapple...baked goods perhaps? Palate: A very mushroom-forward entry gives way to sweet, cooked agave, followed by drying cinnamon, balanced with some citral, herbal, and vegetal notes in the middle. Mushrooms return on the satisfying, medium finish, along with black peppercorns, agave, and minerals. Not too dry, not too sweet. IMHO, you'd have to really like mushrooms to enjoy this batch! Furthermore, this brand may be in danger of being crushed by the weight of it's outstanding reputation...Not overrated, but also not for noobs with Americanized tastes.",

The flavor and finish are excellent - mildly sweet agave with a long delicious finish.  Excellent expression all-around.Initial tasting from 2016Smell reminds me a bit of silly putty. Agave is there but not ripe or maybe something else is wrong with this specific bottle.  Not very pleasant.  Flavor is pretty flat.  Need to taste again and update my rating.",

As is typical, the notes on the nose are expressed in the flavor profile. There's a nice intensity of flavors... along with that citrusy peppery alcohol, and a buttery smooth mouth feel which finishes light and smooth. Mmm Mmm good!",

Or at least a good value.Not much going on with the aroma. But nothing bad. Maybe a little herbal and fruity.  The taste is where this one shines! It is strong in flavor\u2026 And a bit hot with alcohol. Definitely not smooth\u2014 it lets you know it is there and says hola.  There are some notes of pitted fruit, maybe plum. Also there\u2019s a light hint of some dark sweetness, like brown sugar. But it is not overly sweet.  Definitely some pepper and maybe even some light chile. The finish is good with some good tingles on your tongue.  Thanks again for the free bottle OTT!",

Then there\u2019s a sweetness that reminds me of French oak but their \u201cpremium\u201d uses American, so I\u2019m not sure. There\u2019s a sweet fruity note that is almost like dates. If I was nosing this blind, I\u2019d think it was an a\u00f1ejo. Excellent nose. There\u2019s a bit of Ethanol but it opens up and that disappears entirely.Cooked agave, some vanilla. Not really a lot going on. Definitely a little oak and pepper, possibly the caramel but it\u2019s faint and it could be the nose tricking me. Short finish.Overall Pretty decent. For $25, it\u2019s decent enough as a sipper but I felt the blanco was tastier, the oak is overpowering for me, and I\u2019m not loving it. Still good, but I think Arette reposado is a better budget buy.",

Disappointment with this for me mainly stems from the cost that is over 3 times the shelf price of any of the prior releases. It also is aged for less than half the time of any of the others at just over 3 years. I realize I\u2019m bucking the idiot influencers and Insta posters but this gets a middle finger from me and earned a can\u2019t recommend and a 3 for value. I\u2019m being kind.

Fruity agave, herbs, white pepper, and a tropical fruit/vanilla note emerge with time. A touch of dandelion?Flavor:   This delivers clean sweet agave with a pepper backbone. A pleasing mouthfeel. As it opens up, some playful baking spices and subtle vanilla round out the tasting.  Finishes with a tiny amargo note. A respectable repo that won\u2019t break the bank.",

Spicy heat sits right on top of sweet fruit flavor at the open. (This is a contrast to many tequilas that open with sweetness then shift to spice. A really nice blend here.) These two continue to blend and dissipate at a similar pace in a mid to long finish. Again, the higher ABV is hardly noticeable in terms of heat but does push the agave and other flavors forward.Quite a bit of similarity between the Pasote and the Volans but to my taste the Pasote comes out slightly ahead.12-24-20197th Annual Xmas XA tasting",

        "Review": "Aged 4 years in used barrels, this XA from the mind of Felipe Camarena has a golden color with some copper highlights. Presented in a polished, heavy glass bottle and a basic clamshell case this resembles the well known Avion 44 package. At a similar price point  to the A 44 this XA has a very different flavor profile with a full and robust flavor imparted by Bib & Tucker barrels in El Pandillo's cellar. At 45% ABV this has a ton of spice on the palate from agave and barrel spice of caramel, oak, clove as well as a nice bite from the higher ABV. The taste is full with natural sweetness and some nice oiliness and really blooms with a small amount held in the mouth and worked around the tongue and gums for 20-30 seconds before swallowing. This finishes with a hint of bitter from the barrel but with everything else going on it isn't worth taking score away.",

It has a nice oily mouthfeel. The taste of citrus comes through with the wonderful explosion of cooked agave.  It also has a nice influence from the Dickel barrel used but weirdly and surprising enough not what you expect. While it does have a nice vanilla flavor some other flavors surprise you like grilled pineapple!  I don't get any chocolate or caramel from the barrel and I seriously don't mind it at all!  It's a must have for anyone serious about tequila.  Wonderful experience!",

The aroma personality on this one is very complex and inviting. Taste:Heavy cooked agave that just coats your mouth instantly with a buttery texture while showcasing a crisp framework. The heat you will receive from this blanco is with a punch of flavor and alcohol intensity is minimal. Another thing  you will be able to perceive its some minerality, that comes from their water source. The finish will have some astringency, not bad as is something I enjoy from time to time. Aftertaste is very rich and leaves a harmonious lingering agave flavor. Price: $100",

Just an afterthought, I am going to blind taste this vs Siembra Valles Ancestral as I didn\u2019t rank that bottle very high; I almost feel like they are very similar, but Ancestral is north of $120 USD.",

I appreciate nice legs and this had some.  (Just my quirk when I\u2019m sipping and relaxing.). The mouthfeel is a light oily. The finish is mostly agave but does have some warmth.  Not a burn but some warmth that coats your back cheeks and maybe a little chest.  Not as complex as Excellia but enjoyable. The price is better than Excellia.

The finish is a nice medium to long.Overall outstanding tequila and would highly recommend!",

Followed up with the scents reminding me of Grandma\u2019s dank root cellar - very earthy and holding flinty mineral elements. A touch of barnyard funk (not a bad thing). Balanced barrel spices complement the up front agave aromas. The faintest hint of oak.  Somewhat subdued aromas. Flavor:   Silky, oily, buttery. Agave forward natural sweetness, robust pepper & spice, fruit, a muted pencil shavings note and creamy butterscotch all blend in a very balanced fashion.

You draw it in and hold \u2013 the wet viscous warmth washes over you from the point of entry, down the spine. Your mouth begins to tingle with spice at the center and back as you taste a light touch of butterscotch. You are seduced. The experience lingers until you're unsure if you are still caught in it or merely enraptured in its memory. You return for more...Incredible, luscious, well balanced.

This is different and similar to Fortaleza. I think with food the Fortaleza is more open and laid back. For just sipping the 1414 is a tad more bold and a bit more flavorful.",

Nose: Mild raw agave sweetness is met immediately with black pepper and alcohol. However, letting this open up you get lime, tangerine, and lemon notes with a slight minerality. Faint hints of lemongrass, earth and limestone.  A bit out of balance, but there us a lot going on in the nose.Taste: Not particularly complex.  Thin mouthfeel with a bitter punch that is quickly overtaken by black pepper.  A slight brinneyness and minerality. Not bad, enjoyable enough to one can sip.Finish: Short to medium length with pepper that sticks to the tip of your tongue.",

There were plenty of citrus and pepper notes to it which I seek out and was happy to have tried them. Was a little skeptical by the canteen bottle but was glad I tried it... I do have to make a sidenote. The flavors of mint chocolate red pepper and mango are also phenomenal if you're into that sort of thing for a variety of drinks or for someone who is new to tequila. I was really digging the mango as it was not overly sweet but had enough character to stand up to the flavors. One could even just send it over rice if they have the dire need to have some additional flavorings.",

Then a vanilla cinnamon custard sensation crept in. Following were meaty, earthy notes.   All this wrapped up in spicy cinnamon, anise, fruity package. Flavor:  Considerably more oak presents on the palate than did on the nosing. More whiskey flavor. The agave and fruit notes take a step back from the nose.  Given a little more time, I got more vanilla, nuts, pepper, minerals and a hint of cherry. Finish: A long, complex and elegant finish. The price knocked the rating down a few points, and a little too much oak presence for my preference. A revisit and tweak on my original rating.  June 16, 2018",

Not sure if there are additives and they're very well maybe but if so very light and cannot taste them at all. Not sure if they do that for a party store barrels but the nose on this is just spectacular. Agave, wood, spice, butterscotch. definite hint of bourbon . Taste does start out a little thin and not very viscous but soon in comes creeping agave and wood and pepper and Bourbon and Carmel. finish is just barely a touch hot but very enjoyable. I like this more than I thought I would, will definitely buy again.",

Subtle hits of caramel with great aroma of cinnamon and a tad bit of pepper. Palate: the taste of oak is stronger than the nose yet it\u2019s pleasant and doesn\u2019t outshine the agave. Slight initial burn with an amazing slightly oily mouthfeel.This is a great a\u00f1ejo from Cazcanes.

        "Review": "Had this on the big rock at a bar, after having a pour of Fortaleza Still Strength. I think the fact that I had it after a high proof blanco made it taste way smoother but I\u2019m typically a Blanco guy, so well made A\u00f1ejos are much more subtle and easier to drink if you drink mainly blancos, at least for me. With that being said, this was delicious. Aroma was great, very flavorful with a nice hint of agave. You can taste the quality on this artisanal tequila. It\u2019s one that I would probably purchase for my home bar. I\u2019m all about agave forward tequilas, which is why I usually stray away from oak-heavy or sweet A\u00f1ejos and XA\u2019s, but there\u2019s definitely some agave to this one which I really enjoyed.",

I get lots of citrus-y notes from this but the restaurant I ordered it from served it with a lime so it may be due to that. Light agave, pepper, and cinnamon are also coming through. This is a decent tequila, but in my opinion the a\u00f1ejo/XA are definitely the stars of the Don Fulano lineup.",

The arrival is more cooked agave, a bit of vanilla and orange peel, pepper and brine, and bubble gum (Isoamyl acetate, a fermentation ester making the cut).

The denser French oak seemed to allow to conserve more of the aroma of the original tequila, I get lots of cooked agave on the nose and the flavor. The nose also gives me raisin and honey aromas too. I love how this reposado's taste evolves from the initial cooked agave burst to be paired with \"classic\" Highland peppery notes and just tiny hints of flavors from the barrel. It feels almost like a blanco with a tiny little extra touch from the wood.",

There does seem to have a bit of sweet grape as well (from the port barrel or just marketing affecting perception?). Complex flavor that begins slightly sweet and evolves relatively quickly to baking spice (cinnamon and clove) with some good heat. Finish is warm and relatively long but rests in the throat rather than the mouth.I would say the port cask is having at least some impact on flavor but other than the sweetness and a bit of grape I'm not sure I can be any more specific.",

That may be cheap or expensive, but to me it was a deal. I have now been sipping at it for 10 months. It is one of those tequilas that I am generally happy to bring out for relaxing. But there is something off about it for being tequila. Specifically, the port influence adds a type of aftertaste that doesn't normally come with tequila. It is rosy and sweet and good but not tequila. Purists could pass. Those who like other unusual barrel takes could do a lot worse than this.",

Cooked agave, earth and some Andes Candies (mint and chocolate).Slightly astringent mouth feel from a sufficient amount of alcohol. Drying with a buttery coating on the tongue. Initially sour impression on the taste. Cooked agave, pepper, mint and orange are the predominant flavors. Earth, some dark chocolate and vegetal dominate on the backend with a somewhat sambuca-like warmth to finish. A unique blanco at an very good value, but unfortunately no longer made",

Felipe Camarena doesn\u2019t ever disappoint. On the nose the 5 year is more buttery and has more vanilla but less cooked agave. When tasting the 5 year I taste slightly more oak and the other flavors seem to be deeper than the 3 year. The finish also seems slightly smoother. I like that Felipe utilizes older used barrels to age his tequila in. This allows more of the tequila notes to punch through that aging affect that the barrels have. The 3 year is an excellent choice but the 5 year is a treat! \u00a1Salud!",

        "Review": "NOM1499-The nose is fragrant but not dark & dense.  It\u2019s delicate but not thin or heavy. This A\u00f1ejo is double barreled. They first barrel their blanco for 6 months in Mexican merlot wine barrels and then it\u2019s rebarreled and aged for an additional 12 months in symphony barrels. A symphony barrel is a barrel made from multiple wood types. Corrido uses 3 wood types to make their unique barrels; French Limousin oak, Missouri white oak & Hungarian oak. There\u2019s an earthy sweetness with hints of baking spices (mainly cinnamon), raw unfiltered honey, cooked agave, thin molasses and saturated oak staves. Some chocolate and tobacco sneak in too. This is a tequila that whiskey fans can also appreciate. -For a A\u00f1ejo that\u2019s interacted with so many wood types I can still taste the cooked agave. There\u2019s notes of caramel and a dense combination of dark honey and Mexican vanilla. The barrel influence and some sweet pepper hit the mid palate while the baking spices and barrel tannins linger into the medium and sweet finish that has a hint of orange chocolate. Overall this is great additive free A\u00f1ejo that I love sipping neat but I\u2019d also like to try it in a Mexican Old Fashioned. -Their bottles look great and the back label has a picture of their stacked barrels on the backside that faces the front of the bottle.",

Think of it as pomegranate juice that has been infused with tequila. That way you won't judge this as a tequila, which would be absurd!It is fantastic on ice if you are looking for a sweeter tasting with a tequila flavouring in there. They used excellent tequila in this liqueur : Clase Azul. Probably the best tequila-based liqueur I've ever had. Very smooth, not too sweet. And very easy to drink lots and lots very quickly. It's a bit pricy; but they are using premium tequila; and it shows!",

I found the aroma to be warm, oak, agave, hints of butter, and vanilla.  The taste was immediately oak, followed by agave, then a peppery finish that left me wanting to find ways to smooth out with water.  Definitely reminiscent of those \u201cpunchy\u201d tequilas I\u2019ve had in my 20s when compared to other a\u00f1ejos (ie 1942, clase azul repo to name a few).",

Warm cooked agave right off the bat, then some mocha,  cinnamon, cherry, toffee, butterscotch, slight vanilla. Beautiful viscosity. For a 5 year XA this beauty is not oaky at all! This is my 2nd metal label DF Imperial. almost impossible to find nowadays. I had to leave some behind a few times due to level issues but wouldn't hesitate otherwise. Perfection in a gorgeous bottle, unlike other cute bottles with piss inside! GEM!",

It\u2019s got a nice balanced sweetness, and a bit of vanilla. I swear I\u2019m tasting almond and maybe butter, but sweet. A tiny bit of mint in the finish for me. Many people consider this the weak spot of the Terralta line but I would have to completely disagree. This is fantastic, full of flavor. I almost feel like the reposado is more subdued in comparison. The first sip was an exposition of flavor and at $51 at my local spot, I\u2019ll keep this in stock forever.",

It\u2019s then filtered to remove particles and proofed to 40% abv - 80 proof. The color comes from the infusion. This tequila isn\u2019t aged nor rested in oak. Originally this was going to be an extension to the Tequila Ocho line but it\u2019s an independent brand with 2 other infusions. If you have never smelled cooked agave from a horno, this is the closest experience that you can have without actually smelling cooked agaves at a distillery. It\u2019s cooked agave sweetness. It\u2019s buttery and one note but that one note is excellent. Surprise! The buttery cooked agave smacks your palate. It\u2019s a nice rustic agave taste. There\u2019s some minerality and pepper but it\u2019s mostly agave. It has a pleasant medium finish.",

Pepper on the palate is accentuated by the infusion of the agave azul. Side by side with the original labeled El Primero Curado it's hard to distinguish much difference between the 2013 issued original and the 2019 release. I was anticipating perhaps a small amount of oxidation from the older bottle but it's not there. Perhaps a bit more overall depth to the newer bottle. I wish these had a wider distribution being a one off Ocho product and I look forward to the next wave from Los Alambiques.",

Some earthy cellar notes, and a dash of black pepper. Flavor:   Bold agave is congruous to the nosing. The flavor carries an incense quality that is tough to pigeonhole.  Honey sweetness and sensation on the palate - with kicked up pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg and cardamom heat. Really quite a departure from my experience.

Verdict:Wow, very good stuff here. This is something I\u2019d definitely love to show off to people who haven\u2019t had a more interesting tequila. The light mesquite and the clear pepper notes make this one very, very interesting for me. I\u2019m definitely a fan, hoping the rest of the ArteNOM lineup is this good.",

The nose is a nice mixture of light floral sweetness and some warm earthy notes like hay and minerals with a hint of morning campfire smoke. It\u2019s complex.

I remember I read it was Don Amado who had used the barrels prior. Big fragrant nose from the resting of this now straw colored Cascahuin made distillate in the barrels. A bit of sour cider notes with caramelized agave carried by 43% ABV juice turns into an very aggresive spiciness on intake, slamming the tongue with sharp flavors from the ethanol, the resting, the base blanco itself. Man, I want to taste this at still/barrel proof if this what 43% tastes like. Finish is quite long at the center of the tongue, minutes long really. A worthy addition",

        "Review": "A clean, straw colored blanco. Nose:   Big saucy, sweet and spicy notes immediately jump to the forefront. Baked pineapple upside down cake, comes to mind: The richness of slow cooked pineapple, melted butter & crumbs, caramelizing brown sugar, allspice and cinnamon. An additional smokey pepper note and hints of vanilla creaminess.  Fresh cut orange roses.   A faint smell of attic dust.  A bit of cider. Just the faintest suggestion of Mezcal funkiness, campfire smoke and wood influence at this stage. Flavor:  White pepper and cinnamon heat blast out of the starting gates and refuse to back off. But the heat is a perfect foil to the fruit, agave, vanilla, anise, almond and salted melted butter - making for a rich and oily palate experience. In the mouth, more than in the nose, you find some its Mezcal heritage (having spent 28 days in a Don Amado Mezcal barrel).  Then further stabilized in Stainless Steel for 30 days. Finishing impressions:  Some minerals, grassiness and floral sensations show late in the finish. A lot of sweetness for 24 Brix agave - I have to think the barrels contributed to this.  On the one hand, this is a bold, brash and feisty sip. On the other hand, this is a silky, suave and easy sipper. A great collaboration.",

I drink Scotch mostly, with a mix of cognac, cacha\u00e7a, rum, and other liquor. I tend buy in the $50-$120 range. I met a gentleman who taught me a bit about higher quality tequila. He claimed he owns a large collection, containing bottles close to $2K.1123 - We met at a local distributor. He suggested the 1123, among other tequilas in that price range as an intro into the \u201cmore affordable tequilas,\u201d for what that\u2019s worth. I think they are all excellent tequilas, in my humble opinion, but the 1123 floats to the top. You get a lot for what you pay.I\u2019ll keep updating this review as my experience improves.",

Artenom and Cascahuin really came together on this one and crushed it out of the ballpark! my price point is $55 on this exquisite refreshing complex tequila. this blanco was slightly aged 28 days a lunar cycle in previously used brandy and mezcal barrels. Plenty of agave on the nose and palate and long finish any great tequila should have. so easy to sip no burn or heat. still plenty of blanco traits like citrus grassy and peppery earthy notes. Orange peel, honey and smokey ash, this came out more once I let it open up. Many more nuanced flavors and aromas. Seemed to have no end. my hats off to the Rosales family and Artenom.",

        "Review": "Nose: char and weight, but also floral - mostly hibiscus? It smells pastoral. Some bell pepper, too. Flavor: there's a lovely campfire like char straight through, probably from the mescal barrels. But in addition to the floral notes, there's some brine here, more like olives than the seaside. Citrus as well, which isn't on the nose; somewhere between lime and orange. For the amount of char, it's much lighter than you might expect, though it does thicken up a bit on the palate. This guy is a real easy sipper. Finish: Quick, not overstaying its welcome; there's more spice, maybe habanero, here than before. This stuff is really tasty and approachable for how interesting it is, like a cheery friend with an alt aesthetic. It's the sort of thing that I'll drink in the late afternoon or early evening on a summer day, with the light beginning to moderate, with some cool and fun people who want to nerd out on some spirits stuff.",

ArteNOM Selecci\u00f3n de 1123 Blanco Histr\u00f3rico packs the classic Cascahu\u00edn character with a bit more layers, body, depth, and overall complexity. The purity of the Los Valles agaves really shines loud and clear, from nose to finish. I find the barrel to mainly add a bit more earthiness.

Lots of cooked, bright agave but also some dark earth aroma. In a flute there is noticeable alcohol and hint of smoke. Also a hint of the cement from fermentation. Taste is strong with sweet agave. Definite smoke in the mouth but not overpowering. Tingly pepper on the tongue and throat. Finish is my favorite part. Really long lasting and holds on to many of the aromas and flavors. The hint of smokey espadin is noticeable and good. Overall this is unique, cool and very tasty. It definitely is strong in taste and needs time for exploration.",

The story is this isn't made at NOM 1102, only bottled there which meets CRT rules. Value is added by bottling ergo it can be called Tres Generaciones. Enough of the chit chat, how's the tequila?Pretty good actually, though priced quite high, at least in WA for what essentially at this time is a one off orphan product for Sauza and it's 3G line. Interesting also is that this is labeled Vol.01. Will Vol.02 be a Reposado or simply a second release of this Plata? What about Vol. 3? Time will tell. Agave nose with some earth and hints of the 45% ABV. I have it from a good source that this is only 2X distilled and it tastes very solid with agave sweetness, creamy mouth feel and a nice bite from the 45%. The higher proof leads to an extended finish with the sweetness fading to some earth and mushroom and a well dispersed mouth tingle. Try some and post your thoughts.",

Flavors:   Butterscotch, imbued with light oak barrel notes. The spirited spice medley frolics around the palate. Punchy black pepper slowly recedes and melds with the fruit and honeyed agave. Vanilla, hints of orange pith and dark berries. A little salinity and a mouth watering, buttery texture.  Trace tannins present.Finish:  Tenaciously holds on to the pepper and spicy elements through the finish - but with a creamy almond cream fade out.",

On the nose there's definitely agave, but there's also some barrel and spice notes, as well as alcohol that dominate the aroma. While this expression is not as high proof as their single barrel a\u00f1ejos, it smells and drinks a tad harsher.On the palate, I get an instant agave kick that is then overpowered by oak, bitter chocolate, spices, ginger, and alcohol. The finish is long.To me, the chemistry of the tequila and the bourbon barrels just wasn't there.",

Add to that a healthy dose of baking spice, light oak, brine, pecans and orange with black pepper evenly sprinkled throughout.The long finish is amazing, highlighting the pepper, apricot and whiskey barrel notes while still staying very creamy.Overall impression is that the agave is still the star of the show. This reposado is clean, sharp and harmoniously balanced. An exceptional tequila. I bought this for $54, so my value rating was higher than most, but even at 75-100 bucks, this is a top reposado and should be in your glass.Very glad this particular bottle is my 300th rating on TMM.",

The cooked agave is also present in the flavor but somewhat overwhelmed with baking spices and heat. There is also just a hint of caramel sweetness at the open before the spicy heat takes over. Long, warm finish. The 48.8 ABV on this one seems more hot than the 50.0 on the Alquimia and may be just a bit much for my taste.12-24-20197th Annual Xmas XA tasting",

Vanilla, cardamom, coffee and light butterscotch. There is oak here and subtle cedar notes - but restraint has been given to respect the agave that still shines through. Flavor:   Silky, buttery smooth texture, but carries a potent spice zing. Citrus, green peppercorns, butterscotch. There is a dessert quality to this XA.   Similar to a rich Mexican flan?  At 48.8% ABV, this does not present \u201ctoo hot\u201d. But be warned, as easy as it is to sip, it will sneak up on you. Finish has staying power, with pepper and spice zip and offsetting creamy agave mouth feel.",

Cooked agave, hay, dried fruit, tobacco and slight peach aromas. At 48.8% abv, the alcohol is also in the nose but isn\u2019t overly aggressive. Alcohol doesn\u2019t dominate the flavor at all, as I find this easy to drink. Cooked agave, molasses, and vanilla flavor. Really long cooked agave on the finish. Nicely done, not over-done.",

In mouth, initially has an alcoholic impact but is not unpleasant, butter flavor and vanilla are in the mouth, in the back taste presents a sweet flavor to agave and confirms the black pepper, a smooth and silky flavor in mouth. Highly recommendable.",

It\u2019s then distilled again and racked in vintage Bordeaux barrels.\u201dOn the nose I smell cooked agave, oak, and wine. I also get some slight caramel. It\u2019s pleasant. On the first taste I get a lot of smooth oak and agave.  On the second sip I get sweet agave and wine barrel. The finish is short and sweet. Overall this is a great sipper but the price hurts the rating. It\u2019s priced anywhere between $449 and $349. If you have the money and love tequila you won\u2019t be disappointed but at that price you can purchase a lot of other tequilas.  \u00a1Salud! AustinTequilaConnoisseurs",

I was quite surprised by Patr\u00f3n's \"Gran\" line, especially considering how little I think of the regular offerings. The final aging (2 months?) in the Bordeaux barrels gives this spirit a somewhat unique and rather pleasant favor from the nose, all the way through the medium finish. Excellent, but really only a special occasion choice due to its sky-high price point ($500-$600). Too bad, I really do like it.",

It shocked me how much I loved this combo. Finish- Spicy jalapeno and cinnamon that lasts! A little alcohol heat coats the throat but never knocks me backValue- $38 in Michigan makes this a great deal for those that crave the heat. It would make an amazing Margarita but there are cheaper options. Overall I'm shocked that this is so good and additive-free.",

        "Review": "NOM 1465|At 35% ABV, you are not getting a very robust nose, but pleasant enough. Caramel, a blend of cedar & pine, a dash of vanilla, and ripe berry like fruit. The flavor volume is turned up significantly as compared to the nose. Vanilla wafers, black pepper heat, brown jerk spices and roasted almonds. Finish is \u201cshortish\u201d with a sweet/ hot/ velvety feel. Available at El B\u00faho for $330 pesos - a bargain tequila.",
