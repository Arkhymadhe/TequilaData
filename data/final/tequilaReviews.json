Then a vanilla cinnamon custard sensation crept in. Following were meaty, earthy notes.   All this wrapped up in spicy cinnamon, anise, fruity package. Flavor:  Considerably more oak presents on the palate than did on the nosing. More whiskey flavor. The agave and fruit notes take a step back from the nose.  Given a little more time, I got more vanilla, nuts, pepper, minerals and a hint of cherry. Finish: A long, complex and elegant finish. The price knocked the rating down a few points, and a little too much oak presence for my preference. A revisit and tweak on my original rating.  June 16, 2018",

This is one of them. Anyone giving this a low score is not to be trusted. Even if the specific taste isn't preferred, the quality of this tequila is shockingly delightful and obvious to those who have developed their palates.

        "Review": "It\u2019s a gateway tequila to the higher end of the spectrum, so to speak. Easy to find at most decent enough bars and on store shelves. It tastes really good, lots of oak, lots of vanilla and caramel, it\u2019s a bit on the sweeter side but not as much as other higher end A\u00f1ejo and XA\u2019s. Perfect dessert tequila. It\u2019s one of the tequilas that makes the average drinker say \u201cI didn\u2019t know tequila could taste like this\u201d. Used to be a frequent \u201csplurge\u201d buy in my early 20\u2019s when it was still about $100. Now that I\u2019ve discovered better tequilas and that I KNOW I lean towards blancos more than anything, I don\u2019t drink it nearly as much. Tough to justify spending $120-$150 on 1942 when Cascahuin, G4 and Terralta all have XA offerings for $100 or less. Still, a very fine tequila that\u2019ll always very be special to me. It\u2019s an awesome gift, whether you\u2019re receiving a 1942 or gifting it. Goes great neat, no ice needed for this one. Salud!",

Taste was the same, like Bananas Foster (bananas and heated brown sugar and butter). I just don\u2019t enjoy a tequila where i have to hunt and peck for traditional flavors. In a 2.5 year anjeo, i want to taste the agave first, then the flavors from the barrel. And this just didn\u2019t happen here for me. I tasted the barrel and not the agave. Im probably in the minority, but I didn\u2019t find this exceptional. It was $32 for a 1.5 ounce pour and it was sitting next to G4 Blanco which was $23. Really glad i tried it, but I would have enjoyed Felipe\u2019s instead.",

Forsooth!Anyway, this is a good Tequila.  I\u2019d recommend pairing it with a pound of caviar, a bag and an upscale prostitute.  If those aren\u2019t available, perhaps stick to beer.

        "Review": "It\u2019s the 1942! A very great tequila that is easily recognizable but the price tag has many shy away from. It goes without saying that this isn\u2019t your shooter, the vanilla is the scent that is easily detected, and can overtake the body, but the agave, oak, butterscotch, and earthy aromas and flavor compliment it very well to take a sweet flavor, to a more bodied, well accompanied tequila. Easily enjoyed neat, as it\u2019s very smooth. This is a tequila that has to be in a collection, and opened for special occasions. The price tag is high, but when you allow the aromas to compliment the body, and sit with the finish, you see why this is a very well made and drank tequila.",

That glass was wonderful and the restaurant has a practice of giving you the bottle if you empty it. So I got the bottle. It was that good. The restaurant is fabulous too - please visit when you are in town. I went through another bottle over the next couple of months because it serves up abundant tequila essence yet adds gobs of so much eggy French vanilla ice cream flavor that you almost expect to see vanilla bean flecks afloat in your Riedel. Last week I was staring at that newly-empty bottle and getting depressed until my dear friends gifted me a new 1942 for my birthday. Keep it up Don Julio!",

I detect a small presence of nuts, (not present to me in the aroma) but it is masked by cooked agave that is reminiscent of over ripened pineapple\u2026 Delicious!Citrus notes are present but not prominent, they are mostly subdued by the delicate spice of the wood. There is an extraordinary balance of sweet vanilla and light peppery influences from the barrel that meets this spirit, creating an extremely pleasant experience. Subtle but extremely pleasant.

I've never paid more $$$ for any tequila (or any other liquor) than what I paid for this a couple of days back.  I'd not have ever invested if I weren't familiar with this tequila.  I've enjoyed 1942 several times in the past due to the generosity of friends. It losses a lot of points from me due to the high price point.  I have many compliments and positives on this tequila with no complaints, other than expense.  The aroma is much sweeter than what I look for, but that sweetness is not so apparent in the taste.  I like it a lot - if the price were substantially less to me - I'd be able to afford enough of it to NEVER run out, nor even run low!!!",

        "Review": " 2020 Three Barrel(s) Tears of Llorona ReleaseNose:   Round barrel spices entwined in sweet oak and cedar aromas. Dried fruit, snappy citrus rind, cherries and a tart cider note. Vanilla and leather notes. A touch of wet mulch. No overbearing oak presence so far... and I am detecting agave. Flavors:   Fruity, nutty amalgam with dark chocolate, cafe au lait, and honey. More pepper heat than the nose foretold. Develops a velvety Grand Mariner/Amaretto butterscotch vibe. This profile has great range in its repertoire. It\u2019s like experiencing an ever evolving organoleptic kaleidoscope. Finishes long and luxuriously.  This loses a point on value - more expensive in Mx than the USA.",

        "Review": "It\u2019s a blend of tequilas aged in three types of barrels \u2014 scotch, sherry and cognac. Aged over 4 1/2 years. I detect light cooked agave, dark fruit, oak, dark chocolate, worn leather and unfiltered honey. I taste the cooked agave, cinnamon, dulce de leche, American whiskey and scotch, oak char, plump fruit, black pepper and some light honey. The finish is excellent. This is a complex tequila. Maybe the most complex I\u2019ve had. It has a good mouth feel. The flavors linger even though there is some dryness to it. It\u2019s 86 proof but you can\u2019t tell because there is no alcohol burn. It stays on your pallet for several minutes, that\u2019s a bonus!It\u2019s expensive but I think it\u2019s worth it even if it\u2019s only to ever have just one bottle. It is a one liter bottle.

Coming from NOM 1146 you expect a good starting product and the aging process only made it more interesting.  A little pricey because a nice bottle of Don Fulano or 1146 gives you just as good a Tequila at a far lower price but with less complexity.  So the question is, are all those extra nuances worth it to you.  For me?  No.  But I'm glad I have a bottle to enjoy.",

You can taste the oak forward and the lack of softeners will give those who desire the liquor \"bite\" something to look forward to though it is very subtle and is tempered with an oily feel in the mouth.  Allow it to breath in your glass for a moment and the flavor profile comes through and it won't disappoint. I do think the price is a bit high, though, and probably won't restock when this bottle is gone which is a shame because it is a great tequila.",

Then you can smell caramel,  vanilla, oak, agave & Pete Moss from the Scotch. I have to imagine this is an old distillery with old-world traditions\u2014something like the old west. I imagine the Tears of Llorona distillery having a bunch of older men that have been making tequila forever. All masters of the trade are working together, crafting this fine bottle of tequila.You have to know immediately that you have something special. If you do some research to see how they age this tequila, it is just amazing to think how they came up with this recipe. It is aged in Cognac Casks, Sherry Casks & Scotch Barrels. It is left in each barrel for five years, then they blend the three barrels. I would say it is the Dom Perignon of the tequilas.  If you are lucky enough, your wife or husband allows you to purchase a bottle. You will be amazed. Not to mention that you will be the envy of your friends.",

I'm excited to share with all my Bourbon/Scotch/Whiskey sippin' friends who don't believe there's a tequila out there for them!Notes of Cherry, Vanilla, Oak, with some Smoke and Leather shining through. The sherry, brandy, and scotch cask/barrel aging methods all really pop here.For me, the one thing that dials back the rating is personal preference. I find myself yearning for more of an Agave presence that seems to get lost among all the barrel aged-in flavors.",

Still a good high ranking tequila, but compared to other XA\u2019s the beauty of Tears is the complex oakiness from the various barrels.  I tend to prefer more agave and less complex oak.",

Nose: at first this blanco was nothing but alcohol. I let this one sit for about ten minutes given the age. After about ten minutes it opened up and I got notes of mineralogy, agave and citrus but also still quite a bit of alcohol. Palate: the taste instantly reminded me of vacations in Mexico. Agave bomb for sure but also a ton of minerals, almost metallic. Citrus and pepper on the back end. Finish: this particular blanco actually left me with quite a bit of heat in my chest and throat. There was also a lingering bitterness. I\u2019m glad I was able to experience this one. While it wasn\u2019t my favorite it\u2019s a great budget additive free option that has a finish much more stronger than a typical 80 proof. Would be a great mixer.",

Has a very subtle malty flavor mid-taste that falls off quick, and allows for a nice smooth finish.",

The aroma leans strongly to cider, cinnamon, stone fruit, light vanilla, wheat and a yeasty, lactic component presumably from the influence of the English ale seasoned barrel. This mellows the oak (especially the french oak) that was much sharper on the 2019 edition.The initial mouth feel is warming and coating with a sufficient amount of alcohol.Flavor blends cinnamon, stone fruit, butterscotch, baking spice and cooked agave. The white pepper finish is pleasant and makes for a well balanced reposado. The WB 2020 is the same color as the std Fortaleza reposado. Although almost identical ABV as the 2019 edition, the 2020 has a softer finish. I give it a slight nod over the 2019",

The flavor is interesting, quite soft, and but is mainly from the whiskey barrels. Finish is satisfactory. I was hesitant about this product due to the 3x distillation, but had heard good things and wanted to try for myself.\r\rThe glass stopper is different. It will take some getting used to since it has a tight fitting rubber(?) gasket. I scraped the inside of the neck as I pulled the stopper out. Hopefully, I don't scratch or crack the glass, but that would be my fault, not the bottle design.",

Fresh-clean, but an unnecessarily weird funky sweet baby sick barnyard stale water note.  Can\u2019t put my finger on but not digging it. Not cloying like an additive bomb, but there is something weird going on with either the water or the barrel.  \rMedium finish.",

Still very pleasant but I'd guess this was an anejo if I was tasting it blind. \r\rLots of oak influence on the palate.  Oak, vanilla, and clove are the first flavours I get.  Some tropical fruit and citrus going on as well, and just a touch of cooked agave in the finish.\r\rThe finish is long and slightly bitter with lots of baking spice and a hint of cooked agave.\r\rDespite not having loads of cooked agave flavour, I really like this reposado.  Retail is $120 Canadian here in Alberta, which makes it one of the most expensive repos on the shelf, but it is spectacular!  If this was sub $100 it'd be 90+, easily.",

Flavor:   Spicy baking spices, black pepper, vanilla and almonds, a touch of anise, with a silky mouth feel. Agave shines through. Medium length finish, but it invites you back for more. 1 liter price is $300 pesos, from Feliciano Vivanco,  home of Gran Dovejo.This is a combined rating of an older Viva Mexico from 2014, and the current \u201csquat\u201d bottle iteration currently available.The older repo rocks.

But it lies to you (LOL!), as this tequila has a kick!! Jalape\u00f1o and black pepper with tobacco earth tones and a touch of sweetness before the long citrus peel finish.  This reposado is just as big and machismo as the blanco...maybe even BIGGER!",

I would drink again, but it's not my favorite reposado.Nose: Delicate.  When letting this sit in the glass, I will get similar notes that Grover picked up: Pine-like with citrus and tobacco. More often, I get a fruit forward nose with cooked agave, cinnamon, mandarin orange, plumb, tobacco, nutmeg, pepper and very like oak. I wish the nose had a larger presence. Taste: Mild butteryness with a slight cinnamon and peppry bite.  The balance, depth and boldness of the other notes are too light for liking: almond, oak, and vanilla.   Enjoyable, not but not sensational. Finish: Much like the blanco, the reposado provides a long finish: Cinnamon wamrth and slightly sweet agave.",

Some slight agave sweetness on entry along with oak barrel spice and not much alcohol on the palate just a bit of a grab to the back of the throat when swallowed.

It\u2019s for the procedure during the growth and handling of agave during its lifetime...once it is cut they can do whatever. So the organic label does NOT mean it is non additive. Tried all three expressions during a tasting, all are additive tequila. This is just an fyi, for those that are wondering.On the nose all I got was vanilla and agave. Taste was agave, heavy vanilla, and finished with a bitter citrus peel. Highly disappointed, tasted like any other additive vanilla forward tequila on the market.",

Muted vanilla butter cream, cracked pepper, and cinnamon.  Unusual nosing for a blanco. It's not a combination that I would naturally gravitate towards.Taste:  A raw agave sugar sweetness and smooth mouthfeel.  Slight black pepper kick , vanilla, and faint tropical fruit bitterness (slight) and a little alcohol on the back ends. I am not particularly enjoying the sweetness and alcohol.Finish:Continues with the sweet raw sugar and transitions to the cracked pepper.  Medium length and quite decent.",

Underneath is oak and vanilla, along with a cinnamon honey butter scent. As it opened up, notes of cola, melon, and a mild ripe banana scent also joined the party. The flavor was a bit disappointing compared to the aroma, with the oak and whiskey notes taking over. There was still the agave, caramel, and vanilla, but they were largely overwhelmed by the oak. If you don't mind your tequila tasting more like a whiskey then this is still great, it's just not my thing.",

El Sabor: Complex and deep but very young and tight. This tequila needs to breathe. A little water (tiny pipette or over ice) helps the richness of the complexity come out. A little decanting or water helps move the butter, butterscotch, caramel, toffee and all spice / nutmeg flavors out of the background and balances out the peppery oak. El Final: Decanting or adding water does come at a cost. Before the finish was brute and long. It lingered for days. But after that finish shortens up. Thankfully it has a lot to offer in that finish and the decanted finish is more pleasant even if it is a little shorter. If you are considering testing decanting or letting Tequila breathe or contrasting the difference between neat and on the rocks, this Tequila is versatile. Almost to the point of having multiple personalities.",

The flavor is very peppery and also slightly oaky. The finish is very nice. I want to live it but it's not anything special to me. Maybe it's the Buffalo Trace barrel that makes it too oaky for my taste.",

Not nearly as thick on the mouth-feel as the blanco. Nice fruit flavors and the oak that was not apparent in the aroma certainly shows up here.

I consider myself lucky. a few left on the shelf in this off the beaten path liquor store,ight go back to grab another. is it all agave all the time? No, but a fun sipper for sure. pleasantly surprised. my rating on TMM isn't based on comparison to other normally rested repos. it's solely based on a repo rested in Buffalo Trace barrels, and it's really enjoyable",

It has that earthy smell and feel of a valley tequila, but it finishes with the minerality reminiscent of a highlands pina. When you smell it, it screams tequila valley/town. And they do source their agaves in los altos and distill in el valle. Its a very solid tequila. I enjoyed the aromas and first impression better than the finish.",

It presents in more of a round and mellow style. There is chocolate, vanilla and white chocolate. As it opens a bit, I detect some earthiness or mineral notes, a vague whiff of agave, a pinch of spice and some dried fruit. Nothing standout here for me, although pleasant enough. Flavors:   The initial sip delivers an unexpected pop of pepper, cinnamon, clove and allspice.  Creamy in the mouth, holding the vanilla and chocolate nuances I got on the nosing. I\u2019m trying to dig out some agave here, which I thought the tahona would showcase, but it\u2019s elusive to me. I had waited a very long time to try this expression from San Matias, and was a tiny bit disappointed.  It is well crafted and will fit the bill for many - maybe a dessert accompaniment.

Definitely a bit of a brineyness but it comes and goes. Some charcoal. Full bodied and oily. Very interesting, if you gave me this and said it was a mezcal, I\u2019d believe you. It definitely has some distinct tequila specific notes (yes, I\u2019m aware tequila is a mezcal but you know what I mean!) but very different.

This mezcal/tequila production hybrid is interesting for the proof (over 100), the pit roasting and mallet mashing of the pinas in lieu of roller mill or tahona crushing and a filipino still made of copper and wood for the end distillation would lead you to expect something legendary. While pleasing to sip this juice is as others have said, just a bit too sweet and singular in its taste profile. I would expect more complexity for the care taken during production to recreate bygone methods of making tequila.

It definitely has a smoky mezcal vibe in both the aroma and flavor which lingers for a while on the palate. Nice natural slow-cooked agave sweetness in the flavor and finish comes from a full 5-days in the earthen pit.\r\rAgaves are even crushed by hand before loading into old wood fermentation vats. Finish is very light and gentle, especially for a high proof tequila. It\u2019s a tiny bit too rustic for me, but it is what I would expect of an authentic expression of an ancient time.

Not overbearing but prevalent. Then everything starts to meld, herbs, earthy agave, minerals galore. Finish tastes faintly reminiscent of Derrumbes San Luis Potosi with a jalape\u00f1o popper like uniqueness. You can literally taste the craftsmanship and effort. A unique change of pace.",

You can tell that this has touched some wood and has a smokey taste but still has its tequila sweetness.Finish: I get more pepper, citrus and some vegetal on the finish. You can tell it is a little higher proof but it drinks very easy for 100.4 proof. Overall: This would be a good bottle for someone that likes tequila but is wary about jumping into mezcal or if you just like a little more smoke with your tequila. Just another great bottle put out by 1123.",

First on the nose is a smokiness with underlying aromas of roasted agave and an earthy minerality. It also has a vegetal scent, especially celery. After opening up it becomes almost tropical and herbal in nature. The flavor is very smoky too, with notes of roasted agave, brine, minerals, and an earthiness following. I taste the celery that was present in the aroma, as well as the tropical and herbal notes. The flavor also carries a spiciness, before fading back into a smoky agave taste. Overall, a nice balance of flavors under the initial smokiness.",

Flavor doesn\u2019t have the same complexity as the aroma. (This one has the highest ABV of the entire line at 45. Is the higher alcohol content displacing some of the flavor? Not sure but something is missing.) Flavor does has have some noticeable spice and a bit of fruit sweetness. Moderate to short finish.12/24/2018 - 6th Annual Xmas XA tasting",

        "Review": "Glass: Straw color. After coating the glass, small tears take a while to form before quickly rolling down the glass, leaving a few pearls hanging.Aroma: Let this open up for a couple of minutes to let an initial alcohol aroma to dissipate. Green pineapple, green agave, green apple. I presume these \u201cgreen\u201d notes are from cooking the agaves in an autoclave. Light oak and pepper.Entry: Buttery and slightly sweet, pepper presents quickly.Flavor: Buttery, sweet and peppery, soft agave notes. The sweetness is like that of a white fruit such as apple or pear, but does not really come with its own flavor. The butter notes are from the virgin American oak rather than baked agave. The pepper quickly consumes the experience.Finish: Big pepper with a little sweetness and agave for moderate length. Moist with some dry tannins.Conclusion: The agave flavors are fairly basic and \u201cgreen\u201d due to baking the agaves in the autoclave. The barrel notes are pleasant and what you might expect from virgin American oak. This is a worthy profile and welcome addition to the Don Pilar lineup. If you want to try a repo that doesn\u2019t have whiskey/bourbon notes, or the chocolate/coffee notes you would get from virgin French oak, check this out. Priced at $37-40, it\u2019s an excellent value.",

With that being said, this was delicious. Aroma was great, very flavorful with a nice hint of agave. You can taste the quality on this artisanal tequila. It\u2019s one that I would probably purchase for my home bar. I\u2019m all about agave forward tequilas, which is why I usually stray away from oak-heavy or sweet A\u00f1ejos and XA\u2019s, but there\u2019s definitely some agave to this one which I really enjoyed.",

A taste of cooked agave dances across my tongue and and says hello!!  followed by a nice fruitiness of cherry and pear.. Then on to a little bitter oakiness to balance things out and then leaves you with a hint of vanilla and caramel to keep you wanting more.  A super nice Anejo that is well worth the money.  what are you waiting for?  get you some!!",

There does seem to have a bit of sweet grape as well (from the port barrel or just marketing affecting perception?). Complex flavor that begins slightly sweet and evolves relatively quickly to baking spice (cinnamon and clove) with some good heat. Finish is warm and relatively long but rests in the throat rather than the mouth.I would say the port cask is having at least some impact on flavor but other than the sweetness and a bit of grape I'm not sure I can be any more specific.",

That may be cheap or expensive, but to me it was a deal. I have now been sipping at it for 10 months. It is one of those tequilas that I am generally happy to bring out for relaxing. But there is something off about it for being tequila. Specifically, the port influence adds a type of aftertaste that doesn't normally come with tequila. It is rosy and sweet and good but not tequila. Purists could pass. Those who like other unusual barrel takes could do a lot worse than this.",

Nose: Cooked agave, mushroom-yeasty vibe with an balanced earthiness. Strong vegetal-artichoke notes with traces of cinnamon and citrus that transitions to a soft vanilla-almond cake batter.  Taste:  Mild, natural oily mouthfeel with low sweetness and cracked pepper warmth.  Cooked agave and pepper are predominant with traces of cream soda, citrus cinammon,  and minerals.Finish:  Long, dry with an enjoyable cracked peppery warmth.",

There\u2019s natural sweetness and a cohesiveness of aromas.There is a burst of flavors. The cooked agave runs from start to finish. I get the spices up front; nutmeg and cinnamon. Then the sweeter notes come in; natural vanilla and a sweet cream / creme brule. The finish is semi dry with some whiskey barrel notes but the sweetness carries through and there is a pleasantly light pepper on the tail end that lingers.Let this Anejo open up then enjoy!",

Light touch of vanilla that is getting a lot stronger as i let the tequila sit. The citrus note from the blanco is still there but it\u2019s mixed with the vanilla in a very neat way. Little to no ethanol, notably. The faintest bit of butterscotch, and I keep thinking of the skin of a cantaloupe. Barrel spice and agave in the empty glass.Palate:Much more rounded hit of agave, not muted, but softer. Definitely sweeter than the blanco. There\u2019s a tiny bit of vanilla that comes through, and the cinnamon note is much less pronounced for me. Interestingly, the Barrel aging doesn\u2019t seem to be contributing a lot of the typical Barrel notes i expect, it seems to have mellowed everything and melded the flavors together. The citrus blends with the vanilla for me to the point where they\u2019re almost indistinguishable. Very, very interesting.",

Flavor:   This delivers an initial robust pop of pepper, cloves, cinnamon and anise, which is reined in by vanilla and caramel notes. This has an herbal note or two - perhaps cilantro.",

Assuming this is rested in barrels and then in the pipone with the oak chips added as it can stay in a vessel larger than 600L for an indefinite period of time and still be a reposado. More than 2 months and less than a year only applies to containers smaller than 600L. This is quite golden in color rather than the pale straw of the regular reposado in a side x side. Quite bold and flavorful. Thanks Old Town.rating 777 ;-)",

Bright agave forward with fruit and floral aromas, then same for taste but nice midway blast of melon banana thru end . A bit    of wood but nothing over powering with some nice mineral too . And just the right amount of heat . I may have found my new favorite reposado! Seriously!!!",

Butterscotch, black pepper and vanilla is in the background. I find the cinnamon overpowering to truly appreciate the complexity. The nose is not inviting. Palate: Enjoyable.  Bright, light and mild oily mouthfeel with a mild warmth.  Not a bad start.  Oak and cinnamon dominate. Where is the agave?  Baking spices, butterscotch, and vanilla appear in the mid palate.  The balance and layering of flavors  is a big miss.Finish: Likeable.  Cinnamon, cooked agave with a slight oak tannic bitterness.",

        "Review": "Wow. I really like the 'standard\" 3 month rested El Tequileno Reposado so I thought I would take a flier on this. Very glad I did.Initial aroma reminiscent of pears? Then a good whack of agave. Take a sip. Savor. First impreasion is how wonderful the mouth feel is. This is almost as \"buttery\" a mouthfeel as Azunia Organico Reposado which is heady company and a compliment. Agave flavor gives way to some caramel then more wood notes and then just the right amount of heat. Some nice peppery sense in the finish. The finish? Long stretch of flavors and sensations here. This is a sipper for sure. Sip and savor. Let it lead you on a flavor journey.A bit of a 'tweener\" of sorts as this tequila is a blend of 8 month Reposado and some Anejo. I will need to make myself a flight of my favorite repos soon to see where this stacks against my other tops Reposados like Pasote, Tequila Ocho, Tapatio and others. Well worth your while to seek and sample. I do not sense any additives here. El Tequileno is a very highly regarded brand with a good reputation. Well worth your purchase dollars. This one will be a staple going forward. When my current bottle gets low I will be seeking a backup.",

Taste: fresh cooked agave with the taste of wood that resembles those walnut pecanish hints of smell, but just enough for the taste of agave to be fully present from the beginning to the end.Finish:  medium finish with mild alcohol  burn in the back of the tounge with oaky flavor. Overall, this Tequila is well rounded and balanced from agave flavor to oak taste at the end. I would recommend this reposado any given to Sunday.",

While the finish is long, it\u2019s pretty mild and simplistic.

        "Review": "My first venture into Wild Common, and what an adventure it is. Good lord, the nose is gorgeous. Agave for days, very noticeable minerality. There\u2019s a light brininess, and a creamy citrus note, very orange peel for me. So fruity, and shockingly little ethanol for the proof. The palate is a real treat. One of those rare high proofs that you can tell is a high proof more because of the intense flavor than the alcohol. So much agave and minerals. Very clear white pepper, citrus, and tropical fruit.I would say that this is a little bit of a splurge bottle at $80+, but I\u2019m still going to give it 5/10 on score because it\u2019s really a step above. I\u2019m not a normally a huge fan of the Cascahuin flavor profile, but this is exquisite. This is the Cascahuin I\u2019ve been looking for. I ended up picking an entire case, because it really is that damn good.Edit: I am revising my review. Bumping this up to 6/10 on value and 30/30 on flavor. This is, to me, the best blanco currently in production. I haven\u2019t had anything that beats it, and I keep going right back to it. When I\u2019m in my blanco phase, this does it. When I\u2019m in a repo/a\u00f1ejo phase, this still is amazing. I take a month off of drinking, and this is what I want to come back to. Honest to God, this is my favorite tequila. I\u2019m sorry Tapatio 110, but you\u2019ve finally been unseated.",

A bright, clean nose that has depth, complexity, and balance.  Followed by honeydew melon, tangerine-lime citrus, maybe even the slightest hints of raisins.  Slight notes of green olive saltiness, mint, and lemongrass.  There is a lot to take in and things are constantly changing as this sits in my glass.Taste:  Creamy. Buttery.  A nice sweet and salty dance in the the mouth with a delicious white peppry heat, too.   You really want to chew this to get all it has to offer.  Floral and herbal notes jump out right away, followed by the more fruity notes.  Anise, bell pepper, carroway seeds,  banana-pear  fruits.  Traces of limon and green olives.

Mouthfeel is excellent- doesn\u2019t dissipate too quickly, and coats the mouth to experience this wonderful Blanco. Salud!",

As I kept sipping, the complexity that melted in my palate was delightful:right away white pepper and green pepper were present, followed by a mixture of green bartlett pear and apple. In addition, a citrus layer of orange and orange peel make an appearance.

There's a minimal alcohol detection. Another great tequila from El Pandillo",

It is strong in flavor\u2026 And a bit hot with alcohol. Definitely not smooth\u2014 it lets you know it is there and says hola.  There are some notes of pitted fruit, maybe plum. Also there\u2019s a light hint of some dark sweetness, like brown sugar. But it is not overly sweet.  Definitely some pepper and maybe even some light chile. The finish is good with some good tingles on your tongue.  Thanks again for the free bottle OTT!",

Flavor is full of agave, as you\u2019d expect from Carlos Camarena. Nice vegetal, grassy flavor, anise, minerality and some cinnamon. A little more alcohol but it adds to the flavor without overpowering it. Finish is a little mild but really, really long. This one sticks with you and it\u2019s amazing. Absolute classic, artisanal tequila that is a delight to drink.",

The agave flavor might come out a bit more in the fumes/aftertaste. Then pepper grows into the finish, tingly and moist.This is a great quality value tequila, but when I put it up blind against Olmeca Altos, it surprisingly didn't measure up. I'll have to revisit this comparison again.",

Grapefruit, lemon, and lime all love it (especially yuzu and calamansi), yet its one-two punch of agave and pepper still shine through in any cocktail combination I\u2019ve thrown at it. An exceptionally clean tasting blanco and an unbeatable value too. My new favorite mixer and sipper!",

The finish is moderate to lengthy with lots of cooked agave, minerality and spice.  Overall, this is really good. Outstanding for the price.",

There is agave from aroma to the finish. That is a good thing.  The mouthfeel is watery with the addition of some pepper and vegetal character.  The finish adds more pepper to go with the agave. A little burn/kick which is appropriate.  Not one of my every day drinkers but still good.  Just be aware that some of the points are based on pricing and not the tequila itself.",

Smooth and clean taste with flavor of sweet agave coupled with a little pungent earthiness, black pepper, and hint of smoke. Nice black pepper finish that gives way to mint, citrus, and anise.Overall, this is one of my favorite Blancos since it's so full of agave throughout. Such a mellow but flavorful profile. I noticed as it oxidized I picked up a lot more of the odd flavors like the cheese and especially anise. I'm not a big fan of licorice, but I dig this Tequila.",

Floral, green agave sweetness, some fruity and peppery notes.Taste: A tinge of alcohol, some astringency.  The mouthfeel is a mild light, mild oilyness, with a nice peppery warmth. Agave, light butteryness, and a peppery warmth that lingers.Fairly one dimensional.  On par with Olmeca Altos and CasaAgave.",

(batch: B420121) , flavor is complex, short alcohol finish, conclussion: it was a little pleasant to sip it burns while going down same characteristic of cheap tequilas , not sure if revisiting would help.",

On the palate, I didn\u2019t get as much cooked agave as I was hoping, but it\u2019s still pleasant. There\u2019s a surprising amount of anise/licorice that rolls in mid-sip and overshadows other flavors.

        "Review": "I had to search for this in my area and finally was \"lucky\" enough to find a bottle. I'm glad I was able! The nose opens up with a very aggressive agave forward presence, along with with citrus and a bit of herbals. I do note a whiff of alcohol aroma, but you must breath very deep and it dissipates after a moment. On the palate you get more of the herbal, citrus and cooked agave favors and a bit of cinnamon. The finish has more of the herbal, grassy almost after taste. The burn is short to non existent and is a pleasure to sip. That's not something I say about many tequilas. My wife, a diehard Patron drinker, really enjoyed this tequila tonight. Whether as a sipper or in a margarita. Fairly complex as a blanco goes, smooth, tahona processed and for around $35/ bottle; what's not to like?!?",

Aroma grate!The flavor it's so clean and mellow very nice. At the start I get nice cooked agave and green apple then in the middle I get a vegetal mellow and earthy flavor. At the end I get a nice melon flavor with citrus or lime notes an some nice finish of black pepper.  GRATE JOB ON THIS BLANCO!",

Since I can't do 2 separate reviews, I have averaged the point total and included my notes for both the US import and the Mexican bottling for the blanco, on this page;Viva Mexico is a very tasty blanco (MX bottling - 38%) with citrus and caramel tones. Nice long finish with notes of dry earth - I dig it!  And I gave it 87 points out of 100. US bottling (40%);While this is not a life-changing tequila (unless you've only been drinking bad tequilas), its a great deal for the price! And at $15 for a 1L bottle it can be a game changer for cocktails in bars & restaurants that are still using mixto or cheap mass produced puro tequilas. Is Viva Mexico's blanco complex?, Well, no, not really.  The nose is a little sharp, but has lots of citrus and cooked agave notes topped off with a touch of acetone, it smells like it is big and machismo. The taste is very similar to what I found in the nose as it starts with a bit of an alcoholy-acetone entry that leads to black pepper, then a cooked agave center and finishes with strong notes of grapefruit peel. And yes, this is a machismo tequila! 76 points out of 100.",

Nose:  Straight away I get sweet cooked agave and an herbaceous vibe of green tea and mint. Below that i find organe peel, cinnamon, and pepper. There is a salinity that comes through in the nose - maybe green olives. Also, a little hint of honey.Taste: When I first opened the bottle, I got an overwhelming punch of sweet agave that was too aggressivefor my liking. After a few days, that seems to have mellowed.  The mouthfeel is buttery and a pleasant heat that hits right away and sticks around.   The minerality is more forward in the taste and strikes a nice balance with the salinity.  Cinnamon and vegetal notes follow with a bit of grapefruit bitterness.  Finish:.   Exceptional. The flavors really carry for minutes.",

Right out of the freshly opened bottle, it was similar to Siete Leguas blanco, but a little smoother. Now, two weeks later, it got a lot more fruity with some more anise. It has a slight maraschino cherry taste that I dislike it. To me, that\u2019s not agave and it reminds me more of a cherry and banana liqueur. Pueblo Viejo and especially Arette Classic both have that same flavor and I hate it. If you like the two previously mentioned tequilas, you will like this.",

Followed by warm vanilla and almond butter, dried fruit, nutmeg and tropical fruit aromas. Trace earthiness. Flavors:   Robust white pepper, cinnamon oil, and perhaps some ethanol (this is  bottled at 45% ABV), contribute to an intense heat that reaches a crescendo;  then slowly recedes offering up subdued leather and cedar notes. Finishes with a bit of bitterness - but nothing excessive. I think the repo had the balancing act figured out.",

It is spicy, having a slightly acrid black pepper note, some jalape\u00f1o, a white pepper afterthought, peachy nuances, vanilla and a \u201ccreamy\u201d woodiness.  You have to dig to find agave notes. Finish:   The palate and finish on this tequila remind me of top tier XAs.  It has been a difficult tequila for me to rate. It has more oak and bourbon presence than I normally appreciate. But the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.",

The oak is a little overpowering for me, I\u2019m not loving that.  Nice natural sweetness and some agave hidden in there. The vanilla comes in and out and lingers on the finish.Overall solid. A little overoaked in my opinion, and at $90+, it\u2019s a little pricy imo. I appreciate the use of Mexican wine barrels.",

        "Review": "NOM1499-The nose is fragrant but not dark & dense.  It\u2019s delicate but not thin or heavy. This A\u00f1ejo is double barreled. They first barrel their blanco for 6 months in Mexican merlot wine barrels and then it\u2019s rebarreled and aged for an additional 12 months in symphony barrels. A symphony barrel is a barrel made from multiple wood types. Corrido uses 3 wood types to make their unique barrels; French Limousin oak, Missouri white oak & Hungarian oak. There\u2019s an earthy sweetness with hints of baking spices (mainly cinnamon), raw unfiltered honey, cooked agave, thin molasses and saturated oak staves. Some chocolate and tobacco sneak in too. This is a tequila that whiskey fans can also appreciate. -For a A\u00f1ejo that\u2019s interacted with so many wood types I can still taste the cooked agave. There\u2019s notes of caramel and a dense combination of dark honey and Mexican vanilla. The barrel influence and some sweet pepper hit the mid palate while the baking spices and barrel tannins linger into the medium and sweet finish that has a hint of orange chocolate. Overall this is great additive free A\u00f1ejo that I love sipping neat but I\u2019d also like to try it in a Mexican Old Fashioned. -Their bottles look great and the back label has a picture of their stacked barrels on the backside that faces the front of the bottle.",

I smell an earthy agave scent with a peppery vegetal note. There are hints of citrus peels.  The nose is pleasantly rustic. I taste buttery cooked agave up front and then agave sweetness and mint hits the mid-palate.  Some light vegetal notes appear along with pepper that lingers into the finish. Their bottles are made of recycled Coca-Cola glass and the labels are made from recycled paper. They even use recycled corks with their wood topper.",

Aroma:This certified organic tequila has an entrance that is covered with contrasting layers of cooked agave (caramel & butter), followed by a peppery & citrus (peels)  notes. I enjoyed the sweetness nuances from the cooked agave. After letting it sit a couple minutes, towards the end it provides a musty/minerally essence, wonder if it comes from the deep well water source or cork. The alcohol intensity is at a medium level. Overall, it does not offer a very complex aroma profile, but it provides the essential framework for a well-made artisanal tequila. All layers work on a balanced way to provide an austere and simple profile. Notes: cooked agave, butter, citrus (peels), black pepper, earthy & minerals.Flavors:As you dive in, the aromas perceived before are exemplified once you taste it. The cooked agave sweetness remains, but gets accompanied by some butter & caramelized notes that are more prominent that in the aroma. Mid palate you can get some semi-sweet citrus nuances, but quickly dissipate. Texture is mouth-warming, with a short finish that does leave a slight sweet mint and metallic end.Notes: cooked agave, caramel, butter, citrus, mint, black pepper, metallic",

The nose has a bit of agave but it never overpowers the earth, the dill, the floral notes, and the faint citrus. The taste is where Yeyo shines for me. Canteloupe, briny minerality, cooked agave, lemon, vegetal fresh green pepper, and some spice like white pepper and anise. Sweet but never cloying or artificial... this is prim and proper. Plus it's priced around $40 so one of the best values in tequila.I'm updating my review after a blind tasting but splitting the difference. I was shocked at how much I didn't like it this time. I'll do a 3rd blind rating soon.N- apple, stewed fruit T- soft vanilla, cooked agave, nutmeg, cooked peppers MF- thin and oily F- medium and slightly sweet",

I\u2019m getting scents of salinity, rock salt, and some wet stone. There\u2019s also a nice vegetal note and some cooked agave. This Blanco has a nice classic rounded nose. The buttery cooked agave appears first and then there\u2019s some muted salinity, faint vegetal notes and hints of citrus oils all while the black pepper is building. The finish is pleasant. The buttery agave lingers along with the salinity and pepper notes. This is a great classic Blanco that I\u2019ll enjoy sipping but it would also elevate your tequila cocktails. It\u2019s Tequila, as intended. NOM1414 - Sergio Cruz & Jon BullingerWhat I like about their production process: They use estate grown agaves and stone brick ovens.

I imagined Yeyo would be similar to Mijenta (which is fantastic), but the bottle, packaging, and hype did not match the contents of the bottle. It's not a great sipper, but I'm sure it will work well as a mixer.",

The taste is sweet, subtle fruit and citrus on the palate, not as oily, but a great mouthfeel overall. Sweet agave shines through the entire process.

There's a smooth, buttery mouth feel, and some velvety heat as it goes down. Finish is nice, and leaves some of that lingering funkyness which is not bad at all, just unique.

        "Review": "This is an EXCELLENT Blanco.  At $40, it won\u2019t break the bank either.I get a lot of cooked agave, with hints of baking spices & some citrus on the nose.  The flavor is sweet agave, with a heavier dose of buttery cinnamon and spice... Great texture and mouthfeel, with a bit of pepper on the finish.  Extremely easy to drink.Reminds me of another Blanco I recently tried for the first time... LALO (also excellent), but Yeyo is $12 cheaper.One thing I\u2019m not a fan of is the bottle/name/etc.  I feel like it\u2019s not doing the brand any favors as it seems gimmicky, but the juice inside is delicious!",

I do have 2 bottles of the 1st gen that cost me $25 luckily because they were a closeout. Before finding these 2 bottles I went through several at $45/bottle. This comes from one of my favorite distilleries. I get a grassy and vegetal nose and flavor with intense agave. The flavor fades into some citrus notes and white pepper. I look forward to getting more of this fabulous tequila. Tequila as intended.",

A pleasantly sharp mineral aspect at midpoint, with mint and anise making an appearance as well. Light smokiness, and a sour Mezcal-like suggestion.  It has a warm, round feel to the aroma profile; integrating the higher ABV with no  ethanol excess. Flavor:   Bursts on the scene with gutsy white pepper, fennel & caraway seed, and a counterpoint touch of vanilla. Sweet, viscous and savory. Lots of fruit and agave goodness. A big licorice punch joins the peppery foray. Mouth filling and long lasting finish. This is a vivacious expression that defies your previous notions of tequila.

The cooked agave is front and center. That\u2019s followed by some green mellon, lime, soft vegetal notes, grapefruit rind, thin honey, minerals, white pepper and fresh jalape\u00f1o on the finish.

In a way, it's very fresh and floral, but I agree with other members, that it also has a slightly smoky and funky profile that is Mezcal-like. Don't be mistaken though, this is still a tequila from start to finish - just a very unique one.Now, don't get me wrong, there's a lot to look for when nosing this, but the real experience is in tasting it. The first sip is just jam-packed and overflowing with flavor. On the tongue, I get a lot of sweetness from the cooked agave, followed by ripe lime, cantaloupe, and honey. I also get some slight pepper, licorice, and green papaya at end. The mouthfeel is not too thick, but it's just right. Finish is nice and long, and leaves you wanting another pour.. or three.",

        "Review": "Okay 1579 fans. Felipe and El Pandillo have created another exquisite juice in the name of Volans. I have already rated the XA, which is amazing, but now we tackle the blanco. Typical highlands tequila with green apple, pear, raw asparagus and unripe banana. Seems the brix is perfect around 35 ish, making for a great juice. There is a little smoke to this which differentiates this from Terralta, Pasote or G4, slightly.",

        "Review": "I love Blanco Tequila and Felipe Camarena! The nose is wonderful. I detect a lot of agave, minerals, brine, citrus, lemon grass and some light floral notes. The flavor is excellent. The fresh agave and citrus notes are followed by a nice mix of pepper and brine. The finish is all agave and it goes down easy. It has a nice round feel mostly likely from the oxygenation. Overall this is a perfect sipping blanco for my pallet. If you enjoy sipping blancos then you should add this to your collection. Great job Volans and El Pandillo!\u00a1Salud!",

Some sweetness develops on following sips along with some pleasing mineral notes. This uses all 3 available water sources in its production and it shows in the taste and finish as elements bloom, cover up others and then reveal those again as the finish develops and fades. Nice pepper and spice on the tongue lead to a long satisfying finish.",

Ultimately, I expected more flavor at this price point especially after smelling that incredible agave punch. Terralta has a similar taste profile at a much lower price. The finish is clean but peppery. My preferences out of El Pandillo are G4, Terralta and Primo. For a few more $$, I\u2019d grab the Primo instead of the Volans. It\u2019s more interesting.

Not as \u201csmooth\u201d as other blancos from this distillery, but made up for with tons of depth and full-bodied flavors.Although they\u2019re all great, I think this is more complex than G4 and Pasote.

Nothing too complex here but a very nice every day go to drinker at a great value. Palate: very clean and well balanced for the price. Not too oily and a very smooth finish. The finish was a little shorter than I expected however it was very flavorful. I did not get a whole lot of alcohol burn here and it had some nice shallow depth. Some clay and some earthiness on the palate. I am glad that I purchased this for $22 here in Arizona and would recommend others trying. Are their better tequilas? Yes of course. However for the low $20 mark I think this is an exceptional example of quality at a value. I would highly recommend and I would absolutely buy again.",

This tequila offering has both: oak and smoke.  For me - this tequila was rewarding.  Would I choose this as my one and only tequila?  No, but then again there is no need to do so.

        "Review": "From a nom which can produce a nice tequila (Excellia) yet also produces absolute crap.  I always wonder about these types of distilleries.  Just check your reviews.  I found the aroma to be a pleasant mix of cooked agave and caramel with a slight hint of alcohol on a deeper inhalation.  The flavor was more of the same without the alcohol.  I appreciate nice legs and this had some.  (Just my quirk when I\u2019m sipping and relaxing.). The mouthfeel is a light oily. The finish is mostly agave but does have some warmth.  Not a burn but some warmth that coats your back cheeks and maybe a little chest.  Not as complex as Excellia but enjoyable. The price is better than Excellia.  I found this at Total Wine which carried other variations.  I may take a chance in the future.",

Some fruitiness, and that briny note from the blanco is subdued. Definitely a little bit of whiskey, but subtle. Overall, A great tequila for Review #50 in Tequila MatchMaker. This is, by far, top 5 reposados for me. It\u2019s a tossup whether I\u2019d reach for this or Terralta. Fantastic tequila, highly recommend.

The same volume sample had me thinking the older sample was slightly darker in the glass which is indicative of either a newer char on the barrel for the early lot or it was aged longer.",

The nose is inviting but doesn't blow me away. Mouthfeel isn't as creamy as some of the lots. The flavor has some of the vanilla and caramel barrel notes typical to Fortaleza's repos, but again, not as intense as other lots. My guess is the blanco of this lot also has less of the fruity sweetness of other lots, which is apparent in this repo. The finish is excellent. This is a solid enjoyable lot, but it won't displace any of my favs (14/15/16, 20/21).",

In the traditional lineup of Blanco, reposado and anejo I think the reposado is the sweet spot. where the tequila is perfectly balanced with the wood aging for my tastes.All of the three should be enjoyed straight up or on the rocks, never ever with any mix or adjunct you're just wasting money and honestly it's just a damn shame.it seems this brand has caught on with a lot of people as it's getting very hard to find I did find a liquor store in New York and they had the winter 2022 and they're asking $400 a bottle, significantly more than the recommended price.So note to self, if you're out looking for anything beer, wine, tequila etc and you see a bottle of Fortaleza My recommendation is to pick it up and save it for a rainy day. You will not regret it.JMT",

This starts with muted agave and oak as the aroma.  Nothing boisterous.  An understated elegance.  The flavor adds pepper to the agave and drops most of the oak.  There is also a hint of sweetness (vanilla). The mouthfeel is a soft, watery texture which imparts a certain cooling sensation.  This finishes with more of the agave and pepper with a touch of tannic dryness.  Not burn, dryness.  I can\u2019t speak highly enough of this tequila and you know I\u2019m a very fair, tough reviewer.  You will be satisfied with this and wish you had picked up a second bottle.",

The taste is similarly striking, immediately opening with cooked agave and black pepper. Baking spices and vanilla play supporting roles on the tongue, balanced with salinity.

The aroma was clean with light hints of cooked agave and oak Let me emphasize the clean and light aspect.  The next thing you\u2019ll notice is the mouthfeel. It is a soft, watery feel which follows through to the finish.  The flavor is an increase in the cooked agave adding some pepper and sweetness.  The sweetness is light and creates a balancing of the pepper.  This finishes with some more pepper which creates a warming sensation.(Not a burn.) I like this more than when I was at the distillery last summer.",

From the nose to the finish, there is a bourbon oak note and agave is very prominently present throughout.  I pick up on an unfiltered tap water or garden hose water aftertaste that can be off putting but I get over it quickly.  This is hands down my go to repo or overall tequila for shots/neat drinking.

        "Review": "Lot 84|Nose: vegetal and agave-ey, but moderated; probably slightly tamed by the barrel. A bit of olive, or even a cocktail onion. Flavor: Really light on the tongue (it could use an extra 3%) but pleasant; there's almost some milk chocolate here, or even hazelnut, alongside the notes from the nose, which are still present. It's better with slightly deeper sips, where the flavor is more available (it's more hard to find with a smaller tasting sip.) Finish: pretty fast, with a spicy note sticking around longer, more like cinnamon than pepper.Overall, though I would have preferred it a bit stronger, this is pleasant to sip. It makes me think of very late summer or early fall, when the temperature begins to dip and I need something a bit duskier and more contemplative, rather than sprightly and fascinating. I do like this a good bit more than the A\u00f1ejo, for what it's worth.",

All gas, no breaks. But it works! There are no speed bumps, no road construction, no left lane semi-trucks. Just smooth blacktop the whole way.Finish: Long lingering oaky flavor.Value: More expensive, but well worth it. Not anywhere close to outrageous.Final: This is a tequila to drink home alone in the dark. So interesting and dynamic it is not worth pairing or mixing. Quite a treat.",

This is light enough to still remind you of the blanco but at the same time carries it\u2019s own profile.  Perfectly balanced is agave, barrel spice, butter, caramel, and seriously coats the mouth and glass, just like the blanco.  A fine peppery-alcohol profile with a touch of cinnamon as it finishes.

I do sorta detect the oak.  Peppery heat. Excellent oily finish. Strong green olive - especially on the nose. A bit buttery. Different from other tequilas for sure. Had to hit Washington State (from Vancouver) for this. It is better than all because it is so simple (basic good tequila) but has a different unique aroma and flavour profile. Complex (different) flavour. Very very enjoyable. Truly excellent. Lot 90. Liquorville liquor store in Calgary, Alberta (112 Avenue and Sarcee Trail). Magnificent.",

The 6-10 months versions are much better imo.  This review is for the 10 month aged version (special edition-Tommy\u2019s select barrel, lot 49-R).Nose:  floral, caramel, vanilla, slightly smokey with hints of oak, baked agave.Taste:  Vanilla, honey, and caramel upfront, some minerality, baked agave shines through, and the oak is elegantly balanced.Finish: mid range, with slight bitterness from wood intermingling with sweetness.  Body is slightly less viscous than expected for a reposado.Overall:  this 10 month aged version is simply superb.  It\u2019s bold yet balanced.  I hope Fortaleza goes back to aging their repos longer!",

Some wood notes shine through as well, namely cinnamon and spice. The nose is more blanco than repo to me; I don't really get much from the barrel (although I am not tasting this side by side with the blanco so I can certainly be wrong). Strong baked agave and dry, mineral-rich finish. Not super balanced but I really like the brightness that I associate more with blancos.I guess the story is that Fortaleza, like many others, have some difficulty with the agave shortage. They have a bunch of younger repos out there to keep up with demand. The glass half full take is that we have the opportunity to taste younger repos that have less barrel influence.",

This bitterness overpowered the other positive attributes of this tequila: nice aroma, mouth feel, etc. I strongly hope this aspect fades as the bottle mellows now that it's been opened. The blanco is so bright and refreshing, with notes of citrus and pine, so I had really high hopes for this bottle of reposado. A handful other reviewers noted anise, I guess this flavor could be that -- if you had completely unsweetened ouzo or arak, it might have a similar flavor to this. Just to make sure my palate wasn't off, I followed this with a half-shot of Heradura a\u00f1ejo --it tasted a lot sweeter that the Fortaleza Reposado.",

It\u2019s not the most complex reposado, but for $50 and regularity in availability, this is an easy pick.",

Thin, but slow tears that cost the Ridel nicely.  Entry is smooth and complements the nose in similar fashion.  No alcohol burn in nose or taste. Somewhat reminds me of Casa Nobel XA, but not quite as viscous. Very balanced in taste, but finishes similar to entry and is short.  Overall, a very nice XA, but finish lacking in complexity makes it fall short of a great XA.",

        "Review": "On the nose, this is interesting. There\u2019s clear agave, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m smelling cooked or raw. Definitely citrus notes, and something I can only describe as tobacco, which is a very weird aroma from a tequila in my experience.On the palate, heavy agave flavor and more fruit, reminiscent of banana. The \u201ctobacco\u201d flavor is there, very subtle, and subsequent sips give me something creamy/butterscotchy.Over ice, this transforms into a decent sipper. The sweetness comes out and the flavors combine in a very synergistic way. Very interesting and enjoyable.My verdict: As I suspected, the blanco really does stand-alone a lot better than the a\u00f1ejo, but Im curious about the reposado. All in all, Definitely worth experiencing, but at the price point, I\u2019ll definitely pass it up since it\u2019s only $5 away from ElVelo and $9 away from Tapatio, both of which come in 1L bottles, and both of which are more enjoyable for me personally. Still, this is a very competent tequila, and I\u2019d have no problem recommending it, and one of the beauty\u2019s about our individual differences is that this could be your absolute favorite tequila and you wouldn\u2019t be wrong.",

(I've never seen it before in NY, but I got this bottle in FL). Aroma: agave, banana over powers aromaTaste: Agave, pepper, surprisingly no banana flavor, slight earthiness, subtle cinnamon or butterscotch. Somewhat simple flavor. Very smooth finish (especially for a silver), almost no burn. Conclusion: Good introductory tequila for a non drinker",

Agave notes could be detected later.Thick and chewy with a big pepper explosion right away. There are some agave/herbal/citrus flavors that can be noted, but there is a large mineral/metallic component that became less pronounced toward the bottom of the glass.The finish feels mild and short after the aggressive nose, pepper effect, and flavors, but a nice pepper tingle did linger.This has a lot of machismo\u2014bold, brash and kind of reckless. To be consumed quickly in lively company (preferably after it has had plenty of time to open up). This behaves like an overproof with its big differences between the top and bottom of the glass.Not necessarily overpriced for the market, but there are many many better options out there at this price and below.The antiseptic nose and metallic notes dragged the tasting scores down, creating knock on effects for value/buy/recommend.",

Warm across the palate, pronounced celery with slight honey & vanilla. Delicious across the backend!

Strong agave in both, but with the Valles it\u2019s pepper up front as opposed to the citrus and sweet of the Azul. There is just the perfect amount of minerality here; not overwhelming, but rather complementary.  Both the Valles and Azul have a wonderfully creamy mouthfeel.The Siembra Valles Reposado is probably my favorite tequila, so it\u2019s not surprising that it comes from such a wonderful Blanco.",

Flavor:  oily and sweet and balanced well...I like how this blanco doesn\u2019t let the pepper overpower.  Finish has endurance, is also balanced, and then decides to slow fade.  Very nice.",

This bottle has no lote or bottle number and is in my opinion a much less sophisticated blend when compared to Tears of Llorona which has few peers in the XA world. So I won't compare it to that but to its T1 brethren. Barrel notes and the scotch barrel in particular, are very evident here along with some chewiness on the palate. Some smoke blended with agave and bourbon barrel notes of caramel, oak, and brown or caramelized sugar finish with some lingering sweetness. Pretty good for less than $100.",

It starts with roasted agave. It transitions to trace barnyard, full blown citrus and grassy/herbal notes. Alkaline minerals emerge, green banana, cinnamon, mint and vanilla. Flavor:   Agave is the star with robust black pepper and a silky mouth feel. A slight letdown from the nosing.  Finish:   Rich round caramelized agave clings and lingers, playing off green peppercorns, and spices of cinnamon and anise. I would like to try the 40% USA version. I think this tequila would benefit from a more robust 40%  ABV profile. IMO.",

Minimal sweetness but no bitterness on entry and nice spice from oak as well as roasted pepper from the agave and a not very aggressive alcohol profile make this an easy sipper.",

The nose is sweet, slightly floral with a little bit of that Fortaleza brine. Baking spices and a little bit of straw. Fruitier than the still strength I\u2019ve been drinking lately. The nose very much translates in the palate, with the fruitiness and cooked agave coming through. It\u2019s a gorgeous sweetness that comes through, with a plethora of beautiful flavors.

        "Review": "Lot 100|The nose is...different, yet familiar to me. Produced in a different manner than all previous lotes, the agave is from a different area than is typically used and it claims to be distilled to proof at 40%. Prior lotes were typically agave primarily from the Valle, though not always and usually distilled to 46% and recently bottled at that ABV for the Still Strength Blanco. This has an sharp medicinal note on the nose that I find in the current El Tesoro Blanco, not surprising as the agave used is from Los Altos same as ET. Since the rest of the production is basically unchanged all the difference, for me, is easily attributed to these 2 changes. Once sipped this is classic Fortaleza, wood vat fermented with ambient yeast, twice distilled in several copper pot stills and bottled, in this case, without any added water. Roast agave, outstanding viscosity bordering on chewy, great natural sweetness and a long fading finish highlight some of the greatest Tequila Blanco yet produced by Tequila Fortaleza.",

It possesses the lactic note and olive aromas that I have come to expect.  A brown sugar sweetness thrown into the mix. Flavor:   Vivacious spiciness and black and green peppercorn on entry. A honey like agave richness coats your tongue and fills the palate. Almost creamy. Love the late emerging olive notes. A touch thin on the palate.",

In the nose, it\u2019s already apparent there\u2019s artisanal depth; warm agave, butter, very soft alcohol. Sipping is phenomenal. The mouthfeel is oily and robust. In the front of the mouth it\u2019s caramel, agave, and vegetal. In the back of the mouth it\u2019s buttery, spices, anise, and agave. A few sips are very rewarding, but serval sips in a row makes for a lasting alcohol and cooked agave warmth on the tongue that will obscure subtler flavors in favor of grass, spices, and eventually cantaloupe. Genuinely surprised and delighted every time I pour a new glass. I will sell to always, always have this on hand.",

Then, for a while, Fortaleza was out of stock everywhere. When I finally did pick up a couple bottles, I made the mistake of trying the still strength before the blanco and I missed some of the stronger flavor presences when tasting this initially. However, this lives up to all of the hype and it\u2019s easy to understand why it\u2019s becoming so popular. Very, very good.",

This blanco is very briney, earthy, peppery, and vegetal with light grass and minerality. Sweet cooked agave is everywhere and there\u2019s a really nice olive presence as well. The profile reminds me of the 2018 Fuenteseca (my favorite blanco) and I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s due to the maturity of the agave. Comparing the two, this is less complex but it\u2019s also ~$60 cheaper so it\u2019s way more practical for sipping.

The peppery , earthy and grassy aroma matches its flavor but without the sweetness that I get right up front on the palate. I find all come across evenly at first. They begin to dissipate leaving the agave, which comes out more as it opens up. I get a  long silky agave finish. Texture is silky smooth with a little heat too.",

Aroma is delightful with Caramelized cooked agave, sweet butter and light brine with a hint of olive. Taste is amazing!  Plenty of sweet agave, pepper and tingly pine needles. The finish is reminiscent of the regular blanco\u2014smooth with mild heat and some pepper. Long lasting. Overall improvement on the regular blanco. We will have to compare side by side. Fun!",

I really enjoy how earthy it is. Had high expectations for this one, and it's good and clearly a very well made tequila, just not my personal favorite. Can see why others rate it so highly though.",

Also smell pepper, mint, lemon tea, with hints of green apple pineapple and brass.Taste: Medium alcohol feel with some lip and cheek numbness to let you know its tequila. Agave, olive, pepper, cinammon, apple, jalape\u00f1o, bell pepper, celery and some oregano. Excellent thick mouthfeel with some sweetness I cant identify. Some honey maybe?Finish: nice medium finish that leaves a taste of mint/lemon on the tongue. Nice warm coat on the throat, but not harsh at all.This review was for was lot 89. I had tried this before and enjoyed much more than i did this lot, but i dont remember what lot it was. Either way, its definitely one to always keep on hand.",

And thanks to the Fortaleza Blanco I am hooked.You just can't get the flowery and sweet agave flavors from other base material.Even though it could be a bit more mellow, there is only a minor alcohol burn. But the rich exemplary tequila flavors would definetely suffer from aging or other softening.Looking forward to try the reposado and anejo some time but for my next bottle I will get the Blanco again.",

Agave jumps right away with brine, minerals, and perhaps a bit of rain?  I haven\u2019t had a tequila with this much oily texture, amazing how it coats my glass and mouth.  Not harsh, very smooth, but not lacking the alcohol taste either.  It finishes by hanging around a long while with some citrus, light pepper, and a very mild grass.  Most of all this juice has character and you can tell.  Very balanced, very unique.    I\u2019m glad it\u2019s in my collection.",

        "Review": "Tequila Fortaleza (Los Abuelos in Mexico) is widely considered to be one of the great brands available out there. Distilled by a 5th generation Sauza, this tequila is still made the old style way with a Tahona and old school methods. The bottles are hand blown and the real cork pi\u00f1a stopper symbolizes this brand.Aroma: Cooked agave, touch of earthyness, black pepper, olive and butter. Really pleasant.Initial Taste: Superb creamy agave entry.Body: Wonderful amounts of agave and the pepper spice that goes along with it. The sweetness from the agave and the fruit is still there as well. Complex...while still being light and pleasant with no burn or bitterness.Finish: Ultra smooth. A hint of pepper and fruit remain while a nice agave flavor lingers. nicely for a medium duration.This is just a superb tequila from top to bottom. From the bottle, to how it was crafted to every aspect of the flavor in your mouth this is a winner. The fact that it can pretty easily be found for under $50 makes this probably my favorite blanco. Go out and get bottle. I'm pretty darn sure that you won't regret",

        "Review": "This is one of my favorite blancos, it has so much flavor! Roasted agave is very apparent on the nose, followed by a butteriness laden with olives and citrus. Underneath the bright citrus lies a deeper, earthier vegetal aroma that carries a whiff of spice from white pepper, then fades to raw agave and a dash of mint. The taste is wonderfully spicy and sweet, with blasts of roasted agave intertwined with hits of black and white pepper. There is also a rich, creamy vanilla flavor that lies atop a foundation of the earthy vegetables from the nose. This finished up with a splash of citrus and brine, a very crisp and refreshing tequila.",

This is mystical stuff, a presentation of agave so bewitching, so mesmerizing that it has you constantly going back for another sniff, another sip, caught between trying to make sense of it and yet soak freely in its glory all at the same time. Extreme praise, I know, but there really are few times when a drink catches you so off guard as this. The nose is soft and rich, petrichor, lush garden flowers, jasmine, a light undercurrent of pepper. The palate is buttery, rich, almost moist agave, some tropical fruit like lychee perhaps, a light sweetness that never gets untoward, something even like olive oil too. A very pleasant tingling, almost cooling, emerges in the finish, rich agave and light pepper carrying throughout. This is, clearly, gorgeous stuff, not unlike the decanter it comes in. An all-time great and one of the surest fire ways to make an agave convert of anyone.",

Nose: there's a distinct, and very noticeable mushroom aroma that dominates...supported by cooked agave, and acetone...I noticed a little bit of sea air, and pickling spice...other notes are fleeting, some tropical fruits; starfruit, pineapple...baked goods perhaps? Palate: A very mushroom-forward entry gives way to sweet, cooked agave, followed by drying cinnamon, balanced with some citral, herbal, and vegetal notes in the middle. Mushrooms return on the satisfying, medium finish, along with black peppercorns, agave, and minerals. Not too dry, not too sweet. IMHO, you'd have to really like mushrooms to enjoy this batch! Furthermore, this brand may be in danger of being crushed by the weight of it's outstanding reputation...Not overrated, but also not for noobs with Americanized tastes.",

The flavor and finish are excellent - mildly sweet agave with a long delicious finish.  Excellent expression all-around.Initial tasting from 2016Smell reminds me a bit of silly putty. Agave is there but not ripe or maybe something else is wrong with this specific bottle.  Not very pleasant.  Flavor is pretty flat.  Need to taste again and update my rating.",

Spearmint and herbaceous as well. Nice viscosity as well although it seem leaner than some in recent memory( not that is anything to be trusted)Moderate length on the finish, no huge alcohol burn although a nice tingle left its mark. A well made handcrafted tequila to be sure",

Characteristics from the blanco are still present (vegetal and green notes, etc.), but with the reposado there is a nice kiss of oak characteristics, which aren't overpowering at all, but elevate the tequila. An great example of a reposado. On the palate, the tequila is quite viscous and flavorful. The peppery notes are more pronounced than in the blanco, but still well balanced. Each sip I take, I start to get more and more ripe, cooked agave, complemented by what the oak barrels bring. The finish is wonderful and long lasting.",

There is a hint of American oak right at the end. The aromas make themselves known but they don\u2019t overpower your nose.The buttery cooked agave hits first and then the right behind follows a nice pepper and jalape\u00f1o. The minerality and brine are the backbone. The anise is nice and round and it sits in the middle. These flavors meld well are are soft on the palate due to it being oxygenated.

Oddly to me it\u2019s a pleasant aroma considering there\u2019s only so many surprises you can get with variations of the same agave plant. Palate: The taste is very similar to the nose in the most pleasant way. It\u2019s full bodied, agave forward with an oddly satisfying funky kick that left me wanting more! Hints of cooked agave, cheese, olive brine and a dash of oakiness from the repo/XA blend. Overall this funky agave bomb is one of the most surprisingly enjoyable tequilas I\u2019ve had! Again, there are incredible tequila brands that are all unique yet after a while there is only so many variations of the blue agave you can create. This one flipped that notion on its head!",

Execution of this blend is on-point, if you don't mind the old-feta-cheese funkiness that's layered just below the sweet buttery agave notes :-). Also light notes of olives, light butterscotch & vanilla, and a faint nutty note of crushed hazelnut. The cheesy funk is a surprise, but not off-putting, and adds a nice complexity.MOUTH: The nose influences are also reflected in the taste, with the addition of pepper and fresh citrus fruit rinds. The higher ABV is almost unobtrusive, yet provides a nice level of heat, followed with a finish that's smooth, loaded with agave sweetness, and goes down very buttery... and perhaps just a hint of that cheesy funk, which I strangely enjoy ;-)",

Due to the distillery/brand capabilities, this price seems a bit high despite being a special release.Nose: some alcohol, but also vegetal and herbaceous. A bit muted, but it may be my glass and the temperature. Very rich agave presence likely due to it being still strength.Palate: quite viscous, minerality from the tahona, a slight sweetness from the agave. Characteristics from the aroma are equally present on the palate. Very herbal.Finish: a nice alcohol burn, agave sweetness, long lasting.",

        "Review": "For some time, decades actually, La Pers\u00e9verancia hasn't had the equipment on site to make something like this instead choosing to go all in with diffuser production for all lines made there. The story is this isn't made at NOM 1102, only bottled there which meets CRT rules. Value is added by bottling ergo it can be called Tres Generaciones. Enough of the chit chat, how's the tequila?Pretty good actually, though priced quite high, at least in WA for what essentially at this time is a one off orphan product for Sauza and it's 3G line. Interesting also is that this is labeled Vol.01. Will Vol.02 be a Reposado or simply a second release of this Plata? What about Vol. 3? Time will tell. Agave nose with some earth and hints of the 45% ABV. I have it from a good source that this is only 2X distilled and it tastes very solid with agave sweetness, creamy mouth feel and a nice bite from the 45%. The higher proof leads to an extended finish with the sweetness fading to some earth and mushroom and a well dispersed mouth tingle. Try some and post your thoughts.",

Interesting notes of mineral, vegetal and alcohol when tasting. A nice long finish of agave. The slightly higher alcohol content (42%) also shows through nicely. Generally somewhat ambivalent to Patron products as I feel they are a little boring but this is way more exciting. I paid $79.99 for this which tbh probably a little high since you could be sipping Fortaleza or Cascahuin at that point. Aside from being a little over priced I feel that this is a wonderful and interesting product from a usually un-exciting distillery. I really hope Patron continues with these exciting special editions.",

Butterscotch, Vanilla, not a ton of oak. There\u2019s a lot going on, and this has a very sweet, fruity nose. Almost like bubble gum after it opens up, very fruity. Some molasses. Very complex nose, so much going on. Almost reminds me of a panader\u00eda.The tasting is delightful. More agave than the nose suggests but those baking spices, very fruity and surprisingly sweet. I\u2019m getting cherry, butterscotch and vanilla, and the agave comes through more on the finish. Stunning expression from Felipe, this is damn good. I picked it up for $75 and for me, it\u2019s hard to beat that. High points on value for an XA.",

I am partial to blancos and Ocho quickly became one of my favorite on the first sip.It\u2019s soft aroma delicately takes you to Tequila, MX, with the smell of agave in the air. It\u2019s followed by white pepper and slight citrus. Nothing is over represented. It\u2019s incredibly well balanced. I might make my wife wear this behind her ear as a perfume.Tasting is agave forward, as I would expect from a finely produced tequila. It\u2019s subtle pepper rests gently on a bed of earthy herbs, citrus, and flowers.I don\u2019t need to buy a ticket or GDL. Mexico is delivered in this gorgeous juice.",

The spice warmth spreads mid palate, moving to the back palate. Back palate is host to coffee, dark chocolate, caramel and ancho pepper notes. The buttery sweetness has a dark quality to it:  perhaps palm sugar, piloncillo, or light molasses?  Gobs of  light colored tree fruit (candied apple?) marrying seamlessly into the blend. Coats the mouth nicely and has a balanced, pleasing finish.",

You get the agave with some lime/mint taste. The earthiness is there as well as a decent amount of spicy pepper. Overall, a little to minty and peppery for my tastes.

This expands into a deep, rich, buttery complexity and spreads across the palate resolving into a subtle minty coolness.   I have enjoyed Ocho for several years in a very medium way until now. For whatever reason, El Nacimiento is the one that makes it easy to see why Ocho is rated so highly.   2nd glass- Sweet warmth hitting the lips- confectioners sugar and cooked agave, very smooth and pleasant. Melts in your mouth into gooey gobs (like agave flavored cookie dough) an indescribably sumptuous taste/mouth feel. This transforms into a brief savory explosion that resolves into a complex, balanced bouquet of spices, pepper, and heat.  Short, dry finish that cries for a repeat; lingering nutmeg and agave.",

There's some bite of agave bitterness in the front end, followed by a Spearmint taste the resemblance to mouth wash is undeniable. There's a raw agave bitterness that come in the after taste to round out the flavor, which is a welcome change from this mint heavy tequila. It's an interesting tequila as it's a flavor profile I don't usually come across. However i have to say that mint flavor overpowers any nuance of agave sweetness for my taste, this will not be a tequila I seek out again, at least not this batch.",

For me, I prefer more of a subtle taste profile like that from an Arette Blanco. This Tequila has a strong presence for sure. This is definitely a sipper, but I would probably mix it in a drink due to strong flavor profile.",

Because of Carlos Camarena and what he does with Tequila Ocho. Every year, every field IS different. All of Ocho comes from the highlands, yet each field is different. So even suttle changes in elevation and fields matter here. Pay attention and you will be rewarded.The 2021 blanco from field El Pastizal is the perfect example.On the nose you pick up super notes of cooked agave, over ripe pineapple, citrus zest. There is a somewhat mint and mineral component that gives the aroma it's sharpness. The initial mouth feel is a warming, buttery/oily impact with a flash of nice heat. The sweet cooked agave and ripe pineapple come through on the flavor. (Still greeted with the great oily mouth feel). Tropical fruit dominates, especially pineapple and  banana (maybe not too sweet plantain). Some gingerbread baking spices linger here. It's a great drinking experience that Carlos Camarena has created. Outstanding depth. This blanco makes you appreciate the agave selected by Carlos. Can't stop drinking it. The Master has done it again",

There are flavors of agave, mineral, a hint of jalape\u00f1o and vanilla. A great balance of flavor here. My favorite part is the viscous mouthfeel, it puts this blanco over the top for me. The finish is long and enjoyable. This whole line is great, I\u2019ll never turn down Ocho.",

        "Review": "2017 Las Aguilas|This one is dialed in. It has a yeasty uniqueness and the agave leaps out in front of your nose with an accompanying bouquet of mint, citrus, and herbs.   Clean sweetness to this aroma. A swirl kicks up more peppery coolness plus some nice brine and minerality. Viscous mouthfeel, hint of olive. Plenty of minerality again, interesting how the big spicy ness and the brine flavors don\u2019t fight each other. Clean brine/olive/agave finish that\u2019s unmistakable. To me that\u2019s what stands out here amidst budget brands like lunazul: this one can finish several notes; plus it lasts a loooong time.",

What I\u2019m trying to say is that it\u2019s balanced and sooo well made.  Wow.  It\u2019s got something for everyone.  The finish is a slow fade with just enough of a bite.  Overall this juice is balanced with a thick, chewy, well rounded full mouth feel.  Smooth from nose to stomach.  Plenty oily, plenty of agave, simply wonderful.  I can\u2019t wait for the repo.",

The Agave has layers of fresh and cooked. On the palate the body is light and has a surprise kick and vibrancy to it. For such an agave driven tequila I am amazed how it bright and not oily it is. Mint, peppermint and eucalyptus really show through. Cut grass on the back with confected cinnamon.  Orange peel and citrus notes show them selves on second pass. The finish is long and tingles well over a minute after. Not a lot of viscosity to weight it down. Love this stuff",

You can appreciate here there small batch craftmanship. Some minerality and floral aromas come along the cooked agave. Aroma is just great. But then, I took the first sip and reminded me this was just so low proof (70). Nose and taste really overpromised but its finish and character underdelivered. I was missing some more punch to compliment this nice blanco.I would love to have this in an 80 or 92 proof versi\u00f3n. Great stuff for high pressure autoclave tequila. Will have it again.",

        "Review": "I\u2019ve been trying to find this one for a while. I like the Blanco Alquimia very much. Resting it six years brings a whole different experience.  It is rich, complex and delicious!I let it breathe for quite a while. The aroma is fruity, sweet and earthy. I\u2019m still getting plenty of agave! And there\u2019s even a slight hint of cinnamon and spice.Taste is full and almost like butter melting on your tongue. There is a dark sweetness to it that I like. It lingers for quite some time.  Yes there is vanilla and caramel but also some fruit and citrus.Finish is good\u2026 I wished it lasted a little longer. The sweetness fades into a light butterscotch.This might be one of the best extra A\u00f1ejos I\u2019ve had. Very clean and full of complexity.",

It\u2019s still a bit harsh on the alcohol flavor but overall the flavors of oak aging and the very very light hints of vanilla are there. Still have to knock this down on the price 99$ a bottle is a bit too much. Maybe at 50-60 $ I\u2019d buy it.",

        "Review": "Aroma: Strong vegetal and earthy aroma. Lots of wet clay, pepper, and snap peas. Incredibly complex and exactly what I love in the aroma of a solid classic Blanco. Flavor: Tons of snap peas and grass, hints of pepper and cinnamon. Kind of spicy but in the exact right way. Not overpowering or hot. It's very smooth and complex.Finish: Finish is a little soft mostly hangs around in the back of your mouth but nowhere else. Wish it had a little more but tons of flavors linger.Value: Although a little pricey it has to be noted that the bottles and display are incredible. Doesn't add to the tequila but I won't knock it as much as I would a similarly priced Blanco in not as nice of a presentation.",

        "Review": "Aroma is strongly vegetal with clear agave flavor. There is also a significant dirt/earth note as well as a bit of brine. The flavor is true to the aroma - rich, green vegetal flavors with noticeable agave and a bit of salinity/brine. The finish has good flavor but lasts a relatively short time.The presentation of these bottles is impressive. The full wood case has a leather strap on top and metal latch on front. Lift the latch and the box opens to display the two bottles plus a small drawer with a branded drinking glass.  The bottles have a beaded skull on the front that looks great.9/11/2017",

Let it sit and it opens up to a citrus essential oil and lemongrass, too powerful but slightly interesting after wrestling with it. First swallow lands in definite Robitussin territory with the agave a distant 2nd. Swishing it was tingly but the tingle gave rise to medicine. The finish is trying for cool/fresh/minty/effervescent but it can't shake the dominating medicine flavor. Feels like I drank cough medicine but the agave makes something of a comeback. I'm looking at this bottle like a puppy who just got face-swiped by the family cat.",

This definitely lets you know you\u2019re drinking high proof. Tons of flavor, overwhelming at first. Then the notes start coming through, cooked agave, some green olive. A little bit wet earth, some spiciness and a light hint of that lactic note from the nose but nowhere near as prominent. Very full bodied, oily, and a little overwhelming on the flavor profile. Solid. That heat just comes with the very intense flavor profile I suppose, definitely lives up to the brand name! I would recommend this to somebody who likes high proofs. If you can find it in that $55 range or even cheaper, you\u2019d be golden. I\u2019d probably add another point to value for every $3-4 knocked off the price.",

This explosive tequila is not for the faint of heart.

Nose:   A faint woody oak note that carries some nice barrel spices.  Prominent agave, some orange citrus aromas, vanilla, toffee and some earthy undertones. Flavor:   Creamy in the mouth, with a caramel/toffee dessert feel to it. There are sufficient pepper and punchy baking spice notes to keep your palate at rapt attention.  A slight cedar nuance on the finish.   This is rich, and might work as an after dinner option.",

Notes of green olive, orange, and leather sit on top of a thick, earthy, agave core.  The finish is long and complex, yet not overwhelming.  But it is still slightly noticeable an hour after my last sip.There were not many of these bottles when it was released in 2007.  From what I remember, there were 2007 cases released, which would be 12,042 bottles.  Unlike many other \"anniversary\" releases, this really was a one time offering.  So, I would highly recommend having a bottle or two in your collection - as well as any other tequilas made by NOM 1139!",

Dried fruit, nuts, vanilla and almond cream marry with mellow barrel spice notes. An undercurrent of earthy minerals in the background. This has a very round and polished nose. Flavor:  The mellow, elegant aromas do not prepare your palate for the first sip of this 50% ABV XA.   After an initial ethanol blast, the heat turns silky. Vanilla, leather, burnt almond and toffee notes surface.   Fruit and agave regain center stage. Allspice, cloves, cinnamon and a hint of anise contribute another layer of interest. It is buttery and very viscous. Salinity and a mouthwatering umami nuance tempt you to chew this. A lazy and leisurely finish. Well done.",

        "Review": "Lalo Blanco TequilaNose: The nose is light but I detect sweet agave and citrus (lime). Taste: It\u2019s agave forward, slightly sweet. Hints of lime and pepper. It\u2019s delicate and clean. Finish: Short finish of sweet agave and white pepper. This is an easy sipper. It\u2019s a simple blanco with perfect balance. It\u2019s a sipping tequila. It might be lost in a cocktail. Be carefully because this goes down easy. $45 ATX \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Lalo Re-ReviewThe nose is full of creamy buttery cooked agave. There\u2019s hints of celery and white pepper along with oily lime zest. When I go to sip I\u2019m smelling the cooked agave and it translates into the taste. The agave is prominent and forthright. The pepper is more pronounced and the citrus oil appears towards the finish. There\u2019s a nice mouthfeel. The viscosity is apparent and the finish is peppery with hints of brine. The pepper lingers but it doesn\u2019t overpower. This is a nice well made quality Blanco. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m reviewing Lalo for a second time because I appreciate it more than when I first tried it. Go grab some! Salud!",

The agave is there but so are  harsh chemicals and a lingering ethanol finish.  There are better options out there for less money, flavor wise. If additive free is a must than this may be a good compromise tequila, like diet vs regular soda. I\u2019m well stocked on fine spirits and in my opinion this is not one to consider as a quality drink. This tequila seems to capitalizes on the additive free hype but the flavor is mixer quality at best.",

I have tasted other expressions from Grupo Tequilero, but never been impressed enough to buy any of them. LALO is like Tequila on training wheels. It\u2019s going to turn a lot of people onto Tequila and will most likely become the first mainstream additive-free Tequila to launch into the modern market.My tasting experience presented very minimal cooked agave character, unbalanced flavor, with a short and thin finish.  This is clearly additive-free with no evident signs of manipulation, but I don\u2019t think that fact should sell it alone. I find this to be a great starting point for someone wanting to appreciate Tequila, but you\u2019re still paying more for the marketing than the actual juice. Frankly, it is as much of a gimmick as the heavily manipulated \u201cpremium\u201d brands. The owners are trying to lure you with a story and additive-free verification, but the delivery falls very short. Arette and Cimarr\u00f2n are exceedingly better values. I wouldn\u2019t pay for LALO, but certainly wouldn\u2019t turn down a free pour.",

I am an anejo drinker so I was a little worried about the short resting time of the jovan . Casa Noble does not disapoint this is a premium tequila with a powerful start and a smooth finish . If I am reading the numbering correctly on the bottle , I am drinking bottle 150 of 252 from barrel #23 . Good stuff .",

        "Review": "This is a very light XA. The aroma has a distinct sweetness that comes from fruit notes rather than the traditional caramel or chocolate of so many XAs. There is also a clear minerality/earthy aroma that is a characteristic of El Pandillo tequilas. The flavor is surprisingly light with clear fruit and vanilla. The finish is brief.The presentation of these bottles is impressive. The full wood case has a leather strap on top and metal latch on front. Lift the latch and the box opens to display the two bottles plus a small drawer with a branded drinking glass.  The bottles have a beaded skull on the front that looks great.9/11/2017",

Tasted side-by-side with the standard a\u00f1ejo and they are much different. Only a slight fruitiness shows in the nose. The flavor is smooth and rich with butter, caramel and baking spice. This one is not nearly as sweet as the standard a\u00f1ejo. The finish is a warm spiciness that is very long.I definitely prefer the single-barrel for its depth of flavor and its lower sweetness.8/2/2015",

It has a dark copper color, almost bourbon like. I smell dark stone fruits, especially figs. There\u2019s some light baking spices and dark caramel notes along with hints of old leather and oak barrels. I taste dark caramelized cooked agave that\u2019s oak heavy. The French oak sweetness is up front but the dark heavy leather and aged wood notes follow closely. On the finish there\u2019s a nice oaky dark pepper note with a pleasant alcohol tingle on the tongue. Overall this XA is complex and wood forward. An XA enthusiast and a whiskey fan will both love this unique XA.",

        "Review": "An intense citrusy aroma on the nose, quite a definite presence of nice cooked agave. The overall aroma is so bright that is more reminiscent of a Blanco than a Repo. I love it! A soft an oily mouthfeel that leaves beutiful legs on my Glencairn. Quite bright on the palate as well, it must be young. The bottle indicates it's aged more than 3 months and judging by the light presence of wood I'd say it actually isn't much more than that. It's quite agave forward which I love, with light notes of vanilla and some orange blossom. It reminds me of Ocho although this is a valley juice. This is an extremely nice reposado, very clean and quite smooth, with just the right amount of alcohol spices to make it interesting. You can immediately tell there are no bs additive in this one and just a very light sweetness from the wood. It ends with a medium to long finish which keeps resonating with cooked agave till the end and some mild spiciness. It's really a very solid reposado, although I must say it lacks the remarkable complexity of its blanco edition. Contrary to the Blanco you can't really detect the bagass fermentation complexity in the repo, it's much more straight forward. Very good nonetheless.",

Barrel influence is present but not overt. Vanilla, caramel, spice and a bit of citrus. Balance leans toward agave and I like that. Flavor: Some new fruity flavors come through. More agave, tree fruit, pepper, citrus.Finish: medium-long lots of oak, vanilla and spice. I miss the earthy and chocolate flavors from the Siembra Valles blanco.

Reposados are difficult to do well. This is one of the best Repos I have had. Nose: Floral / Perfume, Sweet fruit; dark plums, raisins. Subtle agave. Complex nose. Taste: Agave sweetness and then the juicy red fruit medley and hints of white pepper. Finish: Sweet fruit and mild peppery finish. Very pleasant. I paid $35 in Austin, Texas.",

There is also a little oaky note as well.Flavor: Starts off with pepper and agave notes but mellows into caramel and cinnamon. And, I think the aging helps me pick up the orange blossom flavor that was in the aroma of the blanco.Finish: It starts off very mellow and build in the back of your throat. It's a nice long finish.Conclusion: It's almost opposite the Blanco. This has a very subtle aroma and a much more complex flavor. But, I still love them both.

The palate has more of the aforementioned along with hints of cinnamon to spice things up a bit and orange blossom and the slightest hint of wood from the aging. Most reposados that I've tried have had way too much oak, almost becoming whiskey. Not this one has a nice balance. It does loose some of that wonderful agave forward presence that is found in the blanco. That grassy note is muted here. The finish is very short and fairly sweet with caramel and spice. Have drank this neat and in a margarita( lime juice, agave nectar & Grand Mariner). It disappears into a cocktail completely. Neat, it's a real treat.",

Just enough oak to round off the edges, impart some flavor, and still let you know that it is a tequila! This is the kind on a\u00f1ejo that was on the market 10+ years ago, but times have changed. Luckily Viva Mexico is still around! And at $18, it's a no-brainer!Musty, spicy, and earthy with citrus overtones on the nose this a\u00f1ejo has sweet butter, light caramel, pear, black pepper, jalape\u00f1o, anise, with a long finish that starts off with that classic citrus peel note that NOM 1414 is known for and leads to a touch of cooked agave.",

Agave and some anise and a long buzzy 110 finish. Puro 110 is fresher and has some underlying roast agave that I don't get with EL. Thanks Bob WolterLobster Bus 12",

        "Review": "2007 Marbete tax stampNose:   In the order that they weighed in:  Light oak, super ripe dark cherry/berry notes, mineral earthiness, vanilla laced with nutmeg and luxurious mature agave. A lot going on, but not a real forceful nose. Flavor:   More bang in the mouth than the nosing belied. Cinnamon, cloves and tickling pepper. Silky in the mouth.  Round, mellow butterscotch, almond cream and vanilla.  Agave complemented with light woody notes. The wood being more of a cedar-like wood than oak. Finish:   Pepper, licorice and a touch of maple syrup. Lengthy, with the tiniest hint a bitterness.  This is rich - could be a dessert tequila.",
