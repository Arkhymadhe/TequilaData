It almost reminds me of lemon rinds. Very simple, but not overwhelming. Unlike anything I\u2019ve ever smelled from any other tequila of this type.

It\u2019s very fresh, and crisp. Again, lots of citrus notes, a slight wood tone and some mild sweetness on the finish. My only complaint is how pricey this bottle can be, and how difficult it has been for me to track down. At upwards of $80-$90 it can be a hard sell, but compared to any other tequila at or above this price range, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a spirit of this quality.
